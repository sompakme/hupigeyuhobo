Her excellent&nbsp;body of work is diverse and&nbsp;critically&nbsp;acclaimed, such as&nbsp;The Help, Birdman to The Amazing Spider-Man and various comedies like Crazy Stupid Love. Adding to her clear talent that is notable to everyone, she also defined her individuality which is accredited to her achievement and popularity in Hollywood. She is an adaptable actor and can take up any character she may be assigned to. She gives off a very impressive spark and has outstanding performances in a variety genre of films. According to Stone, the trust she was given to her by her parents made it extremely difficult for her to&nbsp;act and this fact has contributed most to her triumphs in the industry. She says that trust has made her very honest and patient in life. Emma is one of the most successful actresses in the movie industry today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-adams>Amy Adams</h2><p>All artists need recognition from their audience during their performance. When the acknowledgment comes especially from a superstar, it brings the best feeling ever because it brings much motivation. It helps to build their self-esteem and confidence. Justice League’s Army Adams&nbsp;found herself getting such compliments from a renowned celebrity on her work. Three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep voiced what she believed in and branded Amy Adams as a great actress in the movie industry&nbsp;who is determined to succeed. According to Meryl Streep, upholding and appreciating who you really are as a person regardless of occupying a character in a movie is the most difficult thing currently in showbiz. Amy Adams managed to achieve that so well. Streep said, “Amy has naturally succeeded in this winner take all, dog eat dog business, and it is partly due to her honesty, diligence, work ethic, obedience, her capability of not tolerating nonsense while playing the characters.”</p><h2 id=julia-roberts>Julia Roberts</h2><p>A gorgeous 22-year old Julia Roberts was made a star in the year 1990. Since then she never ceased shining. She wasn’t the famous studio choice to play Vivian, the innocent and clever gal from Georgia with an elegant smile who ended up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the streets&nbsp;of Hollywood. Of course, she is then rescued by Richard Gere. She made the movie work and still manages to make it work 27 years later, despite the fact that most actors struggle with longevity in the industry. Julia Roberts did not only become an overnight star, winning the Best Actress Oscar nomination and the highest paid star of the 1990s, but&nbsp;she was also the start of her era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julianne-moore>Julianne Moore</h2><p>How good is Julianne Moore in acting? There is something that can’t be clarified about Julianne Moore appearance: she appears bounded by her attractiveness. If she grins the one thing that changes is her mouth; the gorgeously organized bones of her head remain intact stating the whole beauty of her face. This gives her an atmosphere of confined intellect which assisted her in the start of her professional career. She played a confused artist in Boogie Nights and a housewife in Safe and Far From Heaven. Lately, she cut loose to channel something in Diane Keaton’s vague comedy, The Kids Are All Right, in which her acting was superb. Moore has never been so funny. In Still Alice, she plays a victim of onset Alzheimer’s and you can see why she won an Oscar for it.</p><h2 id=molly-ringwald>Molly Ringwald</h2><p>She was born on 18th February 1968, in California’s Roseville.

Claire won a Golden Globe for her performance. While speaking from her home in New York City, Claire says that she has never seen a character like Carrie before. "She is strengthened in a different way. The role she plays as bipolar person isolates her”, said Danes. “It’s very tough to make new relations, it’s extremely unhelpful if it’s left untreated and even when it is, it’s malignant. CIA work is also very separating and isolated. I think Carrie just accepts that she will endlessly be a bit of a pessimist. I reflect her as Edward Scissorhands, too – she does not want to get too close to anybody”, adds Dane. Dane still remains best known for her big breakthrough performance alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in their movie Romeo & Juliet. The roles she is normally given are quite opposite to her physique but she still performs extremely well.</p><h2 id=lauren-ambrose>Lauren Ambrose</h2><p>Lauren is very funny.

Despite this, she has always had a kind humility while talking about herself. “I have had a good career but I have never considered myself as one of the great actresses of all time,” she said. “I have never received any historic opportunities or lots of awards. I did my best to get each award I received during my time,” she continued. As she turns 83, she is very contented and satisfied with whatever she achieved which includes an Oscar Award in 1962 for the role she played as Cesira in the film Two Women. Sophia said that her husband Carlo became a very big influence in her life. Sophia was paired with the charismatic and charming Omar Sharif for the very first time, in the film More Than a Miracle. Knowing well that Sharif’s impressive looks took everyone’s breath away, Loren used a zigzag eye language previously unidentified to world cinema.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>Lohan was brought into the spotlight as a model and a commercial actress at the age of 3.

However, she was turned into a bonafide star by her playing a mean girl in Mean Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-chastain>Jessica Chastain</h2><p>Jessica Chastain is a good example of a no-name’s life that was transformed at a very high, unbelievable speed. She was a super poor actor back in 2011 from Northern California who saved coins from the laundry mat with her roommates in her apartment in Los Angeles. Jessica has always had intense red hair, a unique pinched chin, and a captivating grin.

She thereafter received an Academy Award for the best-supporting actress for the part she played in Michael Clayton. Tilda Swinton&nbsp;was also ranked as the World's Best Actress according to TV Overmind. She performs so magnificently in her roles that it’s a wonder how she becomes herself again after acting. In the movie, Doctor Strange, many of the viewers&nbsp;were angry with&nbsp;her&nbsp;role. But she nailed her performance, and she even took it a notch higher to make the character fit her style. Seemingly, she doesn’t seem to grow old, she looks like a woman in her early thirties&nbsp;despite being&nbsp;56 years old.</p><h2 id=lana-del-rey>Lana Del Rey</h2><p>Lana is a vocalist that makes&nbsp;pop music that showcases her sensitive, husky style of singing.

Silent and heartbroken over the hurt and pain of losing her spouse, the widow M comes back home and devours a whole vegan chocolate pie in just a single sitting by herself. David Lowery very vividly recalls the moment in an approximately four-minute long take, but the immobility and silence of the camera make the impression look and seem like an infinity scene that never seems to end. It was Rooney Mara's decision to fill the frame with the knowledge of impossibility that someone who has been through the devastating, painful and horrible process can connect or relate to. She does so with&nbsp;a delicate gusto which is why she is one extremely talented actress worth looking out for in the next few years.</p><h2 id=susan-sarandon>Susan Sarandon</h2><p>A graduate of the Catholic University of America with a B.A in drama, Susan Sarandon made her first film debut in Joe in 1970.
