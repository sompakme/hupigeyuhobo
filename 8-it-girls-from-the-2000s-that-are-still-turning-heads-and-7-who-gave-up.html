My does time fly. When we think about the 2000s and who was popular, then we get a smile on our faces. There were so many "it"&nbsp;girls from that generation and they were either partying in the clubs or&nbsp;making it&nbsp;big in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the day, these were the girls that were turning heads and making the big bucks. These girls were the top girls that we saw in all the movies, some were just socialites but back then being a socialite could be a career in itself. It was a good time to be famous. They were a household name and some were pumping out books, starring in reality shows, and even had their own merchandise.</p><p>These days, an "it"&nbsp;girl isn’t quite like that, it’s harder to make being a socialite a career and Hollywood is a bit more relaxed. Plus, there is Instagram which makes the paparazzi wolves less of a threat. Girls these days don’t party like they used to and we don’t see as many young stars ruining their careers over a little partying. Maybe they learned their lessons from stars like Lindsay Lohan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It"&nbsp;girls of today are a little classier and they are building stronger careers than ever. Let’s look back at the 2000’s and see what IT girls are still turning heads and which ones have just given up.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-engaged><strong>Paris Hilton Is Engaged</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton was making money hand over fist in the 2000s. She was pretty much doing it all. She could have made a career out of being a socialite alone, but that wasn’t enough for her. She became famous because of the many reality shows she was in with friend Nicole Richie.</p><p><strong>She wrote books, started pumping out albums, and starred in movies such as House of Wax.</strong></p><p>These days she is still turning heads, she’s as beautiful and thin as she always has. She still parties but these days she stays out of the police radars. She has built her empire with fashion and fragrance which has grossed over a billion dollars. She is now engaged to actor Chris Zylka. She told E! News that she is sure that he’s the one. "I've never been surer of anything in my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tara-reid-is-rocking-sharknado><strong>Tara Reid Is Rocking Sharknado</strong></h2><p>Tara Reid was hugely popular in the 2000s. She was made famous by the American Pie franchise and she was in a series of teen flicks like Urban Legend, Van Wilder: Party Liaison and Cruel Intentions. She was cute as a button and it seemed as if she was going to go big. She was blonde, thin, and popular, so what could go wrong? She had a series of bad surgeries that&nbsp;altered her body and one too many wardrobe malfunctions and the next thing we knew, she was gone.</p><p><strong>These days, we only see Reid in the Sharknado franchise where she seems to be kicking it.</strong></p><p>She’s also been in many B-rated movies like Party Bus to Hell. As far as TV movies, and B-rated projects she did six projects last year, so she is keeping busy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-richie-has-a-fashion-line><strong>Nicole Richie Has A Fashion Line</strong></h2><p>Nicole Richie was another party girl and Paris Hilton’s sidekick. They were rarely seen apart and they were doing reality TV together. We would have thought these two would have&nbsp;hit a rough patch but instead, they have done the opposite. She’s 36 now and she’s no longer running around wild. She’s a fashion designer with a line called House of Harlow 1960 and it has clothing, shoes, jewelry and handbags.</p><p><strong>She’s also back on TV in NBC’s sitcom Great News which was just renewed for a second season.</strong></p><p>She’s still with rocker Joel Madden which makes it 12 years that they have been together. The two had two children that they named Sparrow and Harlow. We now understand the name of her clothing line. Considering how wild she used to be, she sounds pretty relaxed these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mischa-barton-got-in-trouble><strong>Mischa Barton&nbsp;Got In Trouble</strong></h2><p>Mischa Barton was the Blake Lively of her generation. She became famous because of her role as Marissa Cooper on the popular TV show The O.C. She was easily one of the hottest&nbsp;"it"&nbsp;girls at the time, but her reign sure didn’t last very long. Sometimes for some stars, they burn out too quickly and they are unable to handle living in the spotlight. She left The O.C. only after three seasons and then basically disappeared from Hollywood until 2009 where we saw her on the TV show The Beautiful Life. The year 2009 wasn’t great for the actress as she was placed on an “involuntary psychiatric hold” which sounds pretty serious. In 2015, she sued her mother who was also her manager, Nuala Barton, for breach of oral contract as well as fraudulent misrepresentation. No&nbsp;wonder these girls get into trouble when they can’t even trust their own parents.</p><h2 id=hilary-duff-is-writing-books><strong>Hilary Duff Is Writing Books</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff started off in the industry as a child star on Lizzie McGuire and turned that into a movie career where she was in teen flicks like A Cinderella Story and Cheaper By The Dozen. She also had an amazing&nbsp;singing career at the time as well. We saw her again in Gossip Girl in 2009 where she showed us just what a great actor she was. She has taken a break from Hollywood, but it was by choice. When she started having children, she just didn’t want to be living a crazy life. She told Redbook in 2017,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm not working right now, and at first I stressed about that, like, 'Oh, I shouldn't stay still this long.' And that's ridiculous. I have a child; it's totally fine to not be slammed all the time.”&nbsp;She has been keeping busy though writing New York Times Bestsellers like Elixir that she co-authors with Elise Allen.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-is-not-in-hollywood><strong>Lindsay Lohan Is Not In Hollywood</strong></h2><p>When it comes to Lindsay Lohan, she was big at the time for movies like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. At that time the movie catapulted her career. Lohan had a hard time dealing with fame and being stalked by the paparazzi and she allowed her partying ways to affect her career. She would often show up late to movie sets and be disrespectful as if she was way too important to follow rules. She was eventually forgotten in Hollywood because no one wanted to deal with the drama that followed her. James G. Robinson sent her a letter in 2006 about her behavior on the set of Georgia Rule:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Since the commencement of principal photography of Georgia Rule, you have frequently failed to arrive on time to the set. Today, you did not show for work (all day). I am now told you don't plan to work tomorrow because you are 'not feeling well.”</strong></p><p>We’re betting she regrets tanking her career.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-is-super-fit><strong>Britney Spears Is Super Fit</strong></h2><p>For a while there we thought Britney Spears was going to have the same fate that Lindsay Lohan had. She destroyed her career and her personal life. In 2007, when she shaved her head and proceeded to have a breakdown we thought for sure it would be the last that we heard of the pop star. She disappeared for a while and then appeared in Las Vegas where she signed a five year contract to perform there. From there we watched Britney Spears build her life back from what was nothing.</p><p><strong>She is back to having&nbsp;a great relationship with her kids, she has a handsome personal trainer boyfriend, and this year, she will be back on tour once again.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s a comeback story that we never thought was possible. These days we see a lot of her on Instagram as she performs fashion shows and shows off her fitness routines. She has that pop star body back because these days she is super fit.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-was-the-original-american-idol><strong>Kelly Clarkson Was The Original American Idol</strong></h2><p>Kelly Clarkson was the original winner of American Idol, and she’s been making amazing music ever since. She’s released eight albums in her career and is also a judge on The Voice. She married her manager's son, Brandon Blackstock who also happens to be the former stepson to Reba McEntire. The two went on to have two kids together. Career-wise, Clarkson seems to be doing well but her weight has&nbsp;increased over the years and she’s taken a lot of criticism for it.</p><p>Clarkson could care less though stating that she would rather enjoy wine. "Sometimes I'm more fit and I get into kickboxing and hardcore, and then sometimes I don't and go, 'Nope, I'd rather have wine!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophia-bush-is-making-it-as-a-detective-and-activist><strong>Sophia Bush Is Making&nbsp;It As A Detective And&nbsp;</strong><b>Activist</b></h2><p>Sophia Bush made it big in the popular TV show One Tree Hill, it made her one of the "it"&nbsp;girls of the 2000s. She also married her co-star Chad Michael Murray&nbsp;but they&nbsp;divorced. She went on to make the movie The Hitcher and then has been on the hit show Chicago P.D. since 2014. She’s also been on Law and Order: SVU, Chicago Med, Chicago Justice, and Chicago Fire all as the same detective Erin Lindsay. She was dating Google exec Dan Fredinburg for ten months when he&nbsp;passed because of an avalanche on Mt. Everest in 2015.</p><p><strong>"Losing one of my best friends a few months ago shattered me.&nbsp;There were days I felt like my body had been turned inside out.</strong></p><p>I felt like my heart was on the outside of my body and everyone who came near me was stabbing me. And the crazy thing is that since Dan died, the lessons have come like Mack trucks."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rose-mcgowan-is-fighting-for-a-cause><strong>Rose McGowan Is Fighting For A Cause</strong></h2><p>For a while, she was kicking it in Hollywood after she came on the scene in the movie Scream. In the 2000s she was one of the witches from Charmed. We had thought we lost her over the years because we weren’t seeing her in much. Then after a car accident, she went to get surgery for a scar and then next thing we knew she came back on the scene looking very different from the girl we used to know. Still a beautiful woman, but more in a 'modified' kind of way. She was always a beautiful woman, so we’re not sure why she went to such extremes to look different. These days she seems more concerned with taking down Harvey Weinstein and the rest of the offenders in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-her-own-fame><strong>Kim Kardashian Has Her Own Fame</strong></h2><p>Before her tape was released to the world, Kim Kardashian was out partying with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie trying to be just as famous as they were. But hanging with the girls just wasn’t making fame happen fast enough for her. These days, she is rocking her reality shows while being married to rapper Kanye West. She has created a billion-dollar brand that includes game apps, fragrances and even her own set of emojis called Kimojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When she launched her beauty line KKW, she made $14 million in three hours.</strong></p><p>She has a fashion line with her sisters called Kardashian Kids, so in other words, this girl is laughing all the way to the bank.</p><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-was-fighting-vampires><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar Was Fighting Vampires</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar was in Buffy the Vampire Slayer from 1996 to 2003. She was also still riding off the fame of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cruel Intentions. Still the "it"&nbsp;girl at that time she went on to make The Grudge, Harvard Man and Scooby-Doo. These days she’s still as beautiful as ever and still married to her I Know What You Did Last Summer co-star Freddie Prinze Jr. They have been married for a whopping 16 years and are&nbsp;still as in love as ever. She’s not so much in Hollywood anymore although she was in two TV shows Star Wars: Rebels and Robot Chicken. She is also a co-founder of Foodstirs an e-commerce that sells baking kits for kids. The two are happily out of the limelight and just enjoying their life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-is-a-beauty><strong>Christina Aguilera Is A&nbsp;Beauty</strong></h2><p>Christina Aguilera was another Disney star that broke into a singing sensation. She’s had quite the career in the industry. Even though she went through a bad girl phase, she never had any type of public meltdown like Britney had. She even starred in a few movies like Burlesque alongside singing sensation Cher. She was also a judge on The Voice for a period of time and this girl is still singing. Although she has had issues where her weight has fluctuated over the years, this girl is looking fine these days.</p><p><strong>She is one girl that has had a consistent&nbsp;life over the years.</strong></p><p>She even found some time to get married and have some babies. She did go through a divorce at one point, but she is back in a relationship with Matthew Rutler though marriage doesn’t seem to be a road she wants to go down again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-conrad-is-a-fashion-designer><strong>Lauren Conrad Is A Fashion Designer</strong></h2><p>Lauren Conrad came onto the scene in the reality TV shows Laguna Beach and The Hills. It started her on the road to fame and fortune. She went off to do what she wanted to from the beginning and be a fashion designer. She launched her line LC in 2009 and added Paper Crown to it in 2011.</p><p><strong>She has a lifestyle and fashion blog and has authored a few books as well.</strong></p><p>Her first novel L.A. Candy hit number one on the New York Times Best Seller List. Which is pretty awesome in itself. She went on to get married in 2014 to attorney William Tell, also the former guitarist from Something Corporate. These days Conrad can consider herself a personal and professional success.</p><h2 id=kirsten-dunst-is-still-going-strong><strong>Kirsten Dunst Is Still Going Strong</strong></h2><p>Considering she’s been acting since she was a kid, she has had a strong career in Hollywood. She came into the 2000s with teen flicks like Crazy Beautiful and Bring It On. She also went for some blockbuster roles in 2002 as Jane Watson in Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and Spiderman 3. He career has not slowed down one bit over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She went on to play in Mona Lisa Smile and was specifically chosen by Julia Roberts to be in the movie.</strong></p><p>She has grown more beautiful over the years and her career is still going strong. In 2015 she earned a Golden Globe for her role in Fargo. These days she is dating Fargo co-star Jesse Plemons. She has recently started talking about slowing down and having some kids.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;elle.com.au,&nbsp;wonderwall.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5naGK2tXnGoqmlq12bv7C5jK2fnmViZX1xv4ytn5qsXZa%2FpnnSraClpF2pwrO6yKeeZqCVlrG0ecCnm2ZvXay1sHnCpZyaqpyueqit1Z5krqhf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./big-freedia-daughter-net-worth-how-much-is-freedia-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./big-freedia-daughter-net-worth-how-much-is-freedia-worth.html>Big Freedia Daughter Net Worth How Much is Freedia Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html>10 Real Life Wrestler Relationships That Failed Miserably</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
