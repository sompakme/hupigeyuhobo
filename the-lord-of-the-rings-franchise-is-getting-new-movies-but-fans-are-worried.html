Tolkien's novels, is considered a landmark achievement in the history of film. The trilogy, consisting of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, was a massive achievement, earning over billions worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Fellowship of the Ring, set the stage for Jackson's trilogy, earning rave reviews and millions at the box office. The Two Towers followed in 2002, taking things to another level for the franchise. The final installment in the trilogy, The Return of the King, dominated the competition, en route to earning over $1.1 billion worldwide.</p><p>The trilogy collectively won 17 Academy Awards, including Best Picture for The Return of the King, making it one of the most successful film franchises ever made.</p><p>The Lord of the Rings film franchise remains as incredible as ever, and many of its effects still hold up to this very day, something truly rare in cinema. The franchise has influenced countless other films and television series, and its impact on popular culture is immeasurable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the success of The Lord of the Rings, Jackson and his team embarked on a new project: The Hobbit film franchise. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released in 2012 and went on to earn over $1 billion worldwide. The second and third films in the trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, were also commercial successes, though these films are not as loved as the original trilogy.</p><p>Now that the franchise is a TV hit, as well, it's clear as day that the studio sees how lucrative the franchise can still be. In fact, there are whispers of more films coming to life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Star Salaries: Here's What The Lord Of The Rings Actors Made</a></span></p><h2 id=the-franchise-will-be-getting-more-movies-on-the-big-screen>The Franchise Will Be Getting More Movies On The Big Screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar29785777.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, "Warner Bros. Pictures is revamping the “Lord of the Rings” film franchise. On a Thursday earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced that newly-installed studio leaders Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy have brokered a deal to make “multiple” films based on the beloved J. R. R. Tolkien books. The projects will be developed through WB label New Line Cinema."</p><p>The article then went on to specify that there are still many moving pieces.</p><p>"No filmmakers have been attached to the projects as yet, but in a statement to Variety, Jackson and his main “Lord of the Rings” collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens said Warner Bros. and Embracer “have kept us in the loop every step of the way," the article continued.</p><p>As you'd imagine, this announcement was met with a wave of conversation online.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Amazon Beat Out Netflix And HBO In Its Quest For Lord Of The Rings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=while-fans-are-excited-there-are-some-that-are-worried>While Fans Are Excited, There Are Some That Are Worried</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar29783087.jpg><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user expressed their concerns, while also making a valid point.</p><p>"Y'know, I could get mad about this, cause it's very dumb and a painfully transparent act of milking the life out of that world. But I've got the original trilogy on blu-ray and I can easily ignore whatever mediocre thing they do, so whatever," they wrote.</p><p>Another user also expressed some problems with Warner Bros' approach, even weaving in a brilliant reference.</p><p>"I get that Tolkien's work has become a popular brand that makes tons of $$$ (and therefore tempts studios to continue to adapt it), but guys there were two adaptable books, and both have been adapted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan continues, "Anything else just 'feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread."</p><p>It's not surprising that people are worried about the announced films. After all, the Hobbit films left a lot to be desired, and the original movies are practically the gold standard for franchise films. Not only that, but trying to adapt other elements of Tolkien's world is no easy feat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Former Lord Of The Rings Star Bernard Hill Really Thinks Of The Rings Of Power Series</a></span></p><p>It's going to be some time before we see these films, if they ever materialize at all.
