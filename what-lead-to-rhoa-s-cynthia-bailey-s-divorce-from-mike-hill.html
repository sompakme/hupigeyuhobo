Bailey quickly shut down the rumors, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There was no infidelity to my knowledge</a>. Mike never had sex with another woman during our marriage.”</p><p>Instead, the end of Bailey and Hill’s marriage stems from a lack of happiness. There is much love and respect between the exes, but long distance was not working.
