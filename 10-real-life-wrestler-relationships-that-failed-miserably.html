One thing that is often under looked by the public is how superstars need to be professional on, as well off, the screen. For Seth, this was not the case, as his fiance Leighla Schultz, leaked naked photos of Seth on her Twitter account. As if this wasn't bad enough already, Rollins’ Instagram account was also hacked, posting a nude photo of NXT divas' Zahara Schreiber. Despite Seth being involved in such a tough situation, this is not the first time something like this happens, nor will it be the last time. A failed relationship in the WWE is apparently not something that is uncommon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are 10 examples of&nbsp;other failed relationships that took place with WWE talent, it truly isn't Valentine’s Day without a couple of heartbreaking breakups, enjoy.</p><h2 id=10-diamond-dallas-page-and-kimberly-page>10) Diamond Dallas Page and Kimberly Page</h2><p>Going way back in time, in 1991, DDP married his former wife Kimberly Bacon, known to wrestling fans as Kimberly Page. She was one of the “Nitro Girls”. In July of 2004, after almost 13 years of being together, the two parted ways and ended&nbsp;things in “amicable” fashion, according to sources. Kimberly was a big factor in helping DDP find his new passion outside of wrestling, when she helped him discover his passion for yoga. After enduring some nagging injuries in 1998, Kimberly introduced DDP to yoga, something that would change his life, not only physically, but also help Page change other people’s lives in the process. Diamond Dallas Page is forever grateful for all the contributions his ex-wife made in his life during their time spent together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although, in 2014, according to the New York Times, DDP would engage his new partner, Brenda Nair.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-billy-kidman-and-torrie-wilson>9) Billy Kidman and Torrie Wilson</h2><p>After dating for four years, former WCW stars, Billy Kidman and <a title="Torrie Wilson Net Worth" href=#>Torrie Wilson</a> decided to get married on July 11th, 2003. Unfortunately just 3 years later, the couple would run into some problems and separate in 2006. Their divorce was finally finalized 2 years later, in 2008. Torrie would post on her Myspace page on how she was going through a difficult time and appreciated everyone’s support, she would later delete the comments off her page the following day. Torrie still remains quiet on what exactly caused the divorce, but ultimately thanks Billy for his role in not making her give up as a female wrestler. When times got rough, Wilson credits Kidman for being there for her. Kidman also didn't really discuss much of the situation either, but says that Torrie’s constant schedule on the road made things very difficult for the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Torrie is currently involved in a relationship with baseball player <a title="Alex Rodriguez Net Worth" href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>.&nbsp;The two have been together since 2011.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-dustin-rhodes-and-terri-runnels>8) Dustin Rhodes and Terri Runnels</h2><p>Terri Runnels and Dustin Rhodes began their relationship back in WCW, during the early 90s. In 1993, the two would get married and Rhodes would end up taking her family name, changing his name to Dustin Runnels. Dustin had many&nbsp;relationship problems with his father,&nbsp;<a title="Dusty Rhodes Net Worth" href=#>Dusty Rhodes</a>, which&nbsp;in turn caused problems in his marriage. Terri claims that Dusty would constantly spread rumors about her regarding things such as, cheating on his son and being a “gold-digger”. After many difficulties in their relationship, the couple would split up in 1999, after 6 years of marriage. Despite the divorce, the two remain very close, taking care of their daughter Dakota, who was born in 1994. In 2011, Terri Runnels separated from wrestler New Jack, after a very bumpy relationship. Dustin remarried after his split with Terri.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-marc-mero-and-sable>7) Marc Mero and Sable</h2><p>In 1992, Mero married <a title="Rena Marlette Net Worth" href=#>Sable</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;in addition to getting married, Mero would adopt Sable’s daughter from a previous marriage. After more than 10 years together, the couple split up in 2003 and would later divorce in 2004. The two reportedly ended things on great terms; Sable went as far as calling Mero “an amazing person”. Mero also agrees that the two left things on great terms and it was simply time to turn a chapter in their lives. The two would ultimately end up finding happiness; Mero would end up getting married for a second time in 2009, while Sable would marry WWE superstar <a title="Brock Lesnar Net Worth" href=#>Brock Lesnar</a>, in 2006. The couple has two sons together, Turk and Duke, who were born in 2009 and 2010.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-randy-savage-and-miss-elizabeth>6) Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most iconic couples in wrestling history, what a legacy <a title="‘Macho Man’ Randy Savage Net Worth" href=#>Randy Savage </a>and Miss Elizabeth&nbsp;left, revolutionizing the wrestling business forever. What made this relationship so special to wrestling fans was the fact that the two were a real life couple, something that was rare in wrestling at the time. The two got married in 1984. Miss Elizabeth would later join the WWE in August of 1985, as a manager for Randy Savage. Shortly after her final appearance for the WWE, in 1992, Miss Elizabeth and Randy Savage would file for divorce. Macho Man would go on to marry his long time girlfriend Barbara Lynn Payne, in 2010, and the couple was together when Randy Savage lost consciousness and smashed into a tree, leading to his tragic death. Miss Elizabeth was last seen in a relationship with former WWE and WCW star <a title="Lex Luger Net Worth" href=#>Lex Luger</a>, before passing away May, 1, 2003.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-the-undertaker-and-sara-frank>5) The Undertaker and Sara Frank</h2><p>Yes, you can also add <a title="The Undertaker Net Worth" href=#>The Undertaker</a> to the long list of failed marriages involving a wrestler. Taker first married in 1989, to his first wife Jodi Lynn. Calaway (The Undertaker) had his first son in 1993, Gunner. The two eventually ended things in 1999. Just a year later in 2000, Calaway would marry his second wife, Sara. During his second marriage to Sara, the couple had 2 daughters, Chasey and Gracie. Rumor has it that Sara created a very awkward vibe backstage amongst the other divas, and was said to be over-protective of&nbsp;her man. Ultimately, the two would divorce in 2007. After his second failed marriage, rumors began to surface that The Undertaker was romantically involved with a WWE diva. This rumor ended up being true and in 2010, Calaway would once again get married for the 3rd time to his current wife, Michelle McCool. The couple had their first born in August of 2012, Kaia Faith Calaway.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-rock-and-dany-garcia>4) The Rock and Dany Garcia</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being one of the most positive and influential WWE superstars of all time, <a title="The Rock Dwayne Johnson Net Worth" href=#>the Rock</a> went through some dark times in his life. When divorcing his wife Dany Garcia, in 2007, the Rock hit “rock bottom” by falling into a depression. Failing at marriage left “the great one” questioning who he was and what kind of a father he was, by failing to make things work with his former wife. After being held accountable for his actions, things turned for the Rock. The two maintain&nbsp;a great relationship today. In fact, the two are still working together; Garcia is still the Rock’s manager and runs every aspect of his business. The two also remain very close because of their 14 year old daughter, Simone Alexandra. Today, the Rock is in a relationship with singer Lauren Hashian. The couple is believed to have been dating for several years now. Some even&nbsp;believe that the Rock’s failed marriage was actually because of his&nbsp;new partner, Lauren. Regardless, the two remain together today and were seen walking down the red carpet during the Rock’s premiere of,&nbsp;Hercules.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-stone-cold-steve-austin-and-debra-marshall>3) Stone Cold Steve Austin and Debra Marshall</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his fellow Texan the Undertaker, <a title="Steve Austin Net Worth" href=#>Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;his fair share of marriages. Austin married his high school sweetheart Kathryn Burrhus, in 1990. The marriage was quickly annulled after it was discovered&nbsp;that Austin was pursuing a relationship at the same time with Jeannie Clark, aka “Lady Blossom”, a former wrestling manager. The two ended up getting married in 1992 and had 2 kids together, Stephanie and Cassidy. Daughter Cassidy lives with her mother in England, while other daughter Stephanie, resides in Los Angeles. Austin also adopted Jade, Jeannie Clark’s daughter from a past marriage, and she also&nbsp;lives in the US with her husband and family today. Ultimately, Austin and Clark would divorce in 1999, leading to Austin’s next marriage with Debra Marshall. The power couple would end up getting married in September of 2000. On June 15th, 2002, things got heated between the former couple, so much so that the police was called to their residence in San Antonio. Debra was found by police bruised and hysterical, while Austin had left the scene. On August 14,&nbsp;Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. Steve pled no contest and was given probation, along with 80 hours of community service. Debra spoke out about the situation years later, calling it an act of “roid rage”. Debra also told Fox news that Steve beat her 3 times and she also claimed the WWE put a “gag order” on her, so she would not reveal that Austin hit her. WWE did not respond to her allegations. Austin filed for divorce on July 22, 2002. Finally in 2009, Steve married his fourth wife Kristin. The two split up their time together between California and Tiden, Texas, where Steve owns his infamous “the Broken Skull Ranch”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-matt-hardy-and-lita>2) Matt Hardy and Lita</h2><p>This story sent massive shock-waves throughout the WWE. Matt Hardy and <a title="Amy Dumas Net Worth" href=#>Lita</a> were involved in a long term relationship, spanning through 6 years at the time. The two first met in January of 1999, at a NWA Mid-Atlantic show. They would begin to date a few months later. After 6 years of being together, Lita would have an affair with one of Matt’s closest friends in the business, <a title="Adam “Edge” Copeland Net Worth" href=#>Adam "Edge" Copeland</a>, in February of 2005. The alleged affair sent shock-waves throughout the WWE, and Lita’s cheers began to turn into boos during live shows. Ultimately, the WWE would decide to make a kayfabe angle out of it, prompting the WWE universe to think it was a shoot, as opposed to a work. Despite getting the worst end of it, Hardy today is extremely pleased to be expecting his first son with TNA knockout, Reby Sky. Hardy’s first son is due in June of 2015.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-triple-h-and-chyna>1) Triple H and Chyna</h2><p>Chyna has, and probably always will, blame&nbsp;<a title="Triple H Net Worth" href=#>Triple H</a> for destroying&nbsp;her personal life, as well as destroying her career. Chyna is often asked about the situation that changed her life. It started out&nbsp;with speculation that Hunter was cheating on her with <a title="Stephanie McMahon Net Worth" href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a>, despite asking Hunter several times if it was true, Hunter would never admit to it. Chyna would later go on to do some “snooping” around, while doing so, she found a love letter from Stephanie to Triple H, that was dated a year ago (you can’t make this stuff up). Chyna would proceed to&nbsp;contact <a title="Vince McMahon Net Worth" href=#>Vince McMahon</a> and tell him about the situation, to which Vince responded, “well I guess the jig is up”. Although devastated, Chyna would show up to work on Monday, only to have&nbsp;Vince tell her&nbsp;to go home and that they would work on a new contract. Shortly after arriving home, she received a fax indicating they did not need her anymore. Chyna blames her professional and personal fall apart on Triple H. You can read more on her story in her tell all book, If They Only Knew. Today, Hunter his happily married to Stephanie McMahon. The two got married October 23, 2003. The couple had 3 children, all girls, Aurora Rose Levesque (born in 2006), Murphy Claire Levesque (born in 2008) and Vaughn Evelyn Levesque (born in 2010).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BpZKudkaF6rbXFnmSwqpWowa2x0WapnqSRqbawutKhoKmrXam1osCMn5iipJWZeq610p6pmpqcrnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-real-life-wrestler-relationships-that-failed-miserably.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8-it-girls-from-the-2000s-that-are-still-turning-heads-and-7-who-gave-up.html>8 &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; Girls From the 2000s That Are Still Turning Heads And 7 Who Gave Up</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-most-expensive-outfits-zendaya-has-worn.html>10 Most Expensive Outfits Zendaya Has Worn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-most-expensive-outfits-zendaya-has-worn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
