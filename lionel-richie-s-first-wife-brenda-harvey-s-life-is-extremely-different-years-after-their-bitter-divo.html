Thanks to his constant visibility (and, of course, his daughter, Sofia Richie's It-girl status), there's been a renewed interest in his personal life of late. Unsurprisingly, that has led to some people learning about the explosive way Lionel's first marriage came to an end.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Lionel Richie Really Feel About American Idol And If He's Actually Friends With The Other Judges?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that it has been almost thirty years since Lionel's first marriage ended, a lot has happened since then. For that reason, it is fascinating to look at what Lionel's first wife, Brenda Harvey-Richie, is up to now.</p><p><strong>Updated September 11, 2023:</strong> Despite a tumultuous split, these days, Brenda Harvey-Richie and her ex have put their drama behind them. What's more, it appears she's super close with his kids from his second marriage, Miles and Sofia. In addition to being present for Sofia's April 2023 wedding, the two regularly share their love for one another via Instagram.</p><h2 id=who-is-lionel-richie-39-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-richie>Who Is Lionel Richie's First Wife Brenda Harvey-Richie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/brenda-harvey-richie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During her time at University, Brenda Harvey met one Lionel Richie</a>. They went on to become a couple just as his career with The Commodores began to take off. Then, roughly a year after Brenda graduated from University, she and Lionel tied the knot in 1975.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lionel Richie's Ex Brenda Harvey Has A Surprisingly Low Worth Given His Millions</a></span></p><p>Married for eighteen years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lionel and Brenda added to their family when they adopted a friend's child - a little girl by the name of Nicole</a>. Because Nicole's birth parents were struggling financially and their marriage was falling apart, she needed a loving home, and the Richies were only too happy to step up. By the time she was 9, she was officially adopted, and became Nicole Richie.</p><p>Sadly, however, the trio were only a happy family for a short while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Lionel and Brenda were married until 1993, the couple actually separated in 1988 according to reports. Of course, many <a href=#>celebrity couples have dragged out their divorces</a>. However, Lionel and Brenda's relationship ended in a truly explosive way.</p><p>After Brenda reportedly caught Lionel with her friend Diane Alexander, she attacked them physically and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">garnered headlines when she was arrested</a>.</p><p>Based on that incident, Brenda eventually was charged with corporal injury to a spouse, resisting arrest, trespassing, vandalism, battery, and disturbing the peace. After Lionel and Brenda's marriage ended, he went on to marry Diane in 1995. The two became parents to Sofia and Miles Richie, but divorced in 2003.</p><h2 id=what-is-lionel-richie-39-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-richie-up-to-now>What Is Lionel Richie's First Wife Brenda Harvey-Richie Up To Now?</h2><p>Back to Brenda.</p><p>In the 30 years since her marriage to Lionel Richie ended, Brenda Harvey-Richie has never shown any interest in garnering the spotlight. However, that doesn't mean she's stepped out of the entertainment business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently perfectly willing to put herself out there to a certain degree, Brenda is very active on social media. And, as it turns out, Brenda's Twitter and Instagram accounts are a great resource to learn about what her life has been like since her divorce.</p><p>As noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brenda's Twitter profile</a>, her relationship with the music industry didn't end when she and Lionel went their separate ways. Instead, Brenda owns BRP Music Publishing Company.</p><p>Also thanks to Brenda's Twitter account, it is clear that she had the opportunity to be a reality star. However, unlike her daughter, who became one of the pioneers of reality TV thanks to her time on The Simple Life with Paris Hilton, she wasn't interested.</p><p>After defending her friend, Kathy Hilton's <strong><a href=#>Real Housewives</a></strong> conduct back in 2022, someone suggested Brenda should join the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, she revealed, "I was asked to be on that Show when it first started…….NO WAY…..!!! I really don’t watch any of the House Wives Shows, only a few of this one when I heard what they were doing to Kathy the last 2 weeks."</p><p>Finally, Brenda's Twitter account reveals that she is passionate about politics and is a supporter of the Democrats. That said, her account is mostly focused on her personal life. Unsurprisingly, Brenda regularly posts images of herself with her daughter Nicole on Instagram.</p><h2 id=brenda-harvey-richie-39-s-relationship-with-her-daughter-and-son-in-law-joel-madden>Brenda Harvey-Richie's Relationship With Her Daughter And Son-In-Law, Joel Madden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spl1639062_007.jpg><p>In addition to posting about her daughter, Brenda also celebrates her twin goddaughters, her grandchildren, and her son-in-law. When it was Joel Madden's birthday, she posted an image of him with his brother Benji and referred to them both as her sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though some of her posts are predictable, some of the things on Brenda's Instagram account will likely shock some observers. After all, even though their relationship ended explosively, Brenda also regularly posts in support of her ex-husband Lionel. Such was the case in April 2022, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she urged her followers to vote to secure his place in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lionel Richie's Controversial Parenting Approach Shaped Daughter Sofia Richie's Path To Incredible Success</a></span></p><p>Even more surprisingly, though, in a decidedly wholesome twist, it appears <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brenda has a close bond with Lionel's children from his marriage to Diane Alexander</a>. In addition to her annual birthday posts in Sofia's honor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was also present for her April 2023 wedding to Elliot Grainge</a>. What's more, she often refers to Sofia as her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Making things even sweeter, it's clear the love goes both ways. In a 2023 Mother's Day Instagram story dedicated to Brenda, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole included Sofia in a pic captioned, "We all love you."</a> And, in response to past birthday posts, Sofia herself has shared her love for Brenda.</p><p>So, what's Brenda Harvey-Richie's life like, post-divorce from Lionel? With the worst behind them, it's clear they'll always be family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brjIqKWepF2ntqS0yJ5ksKGWmnqjvsSnm5plmJa%2Ft7HYaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flionel-richie-s-first-wife-brenda-harvey-s-life-is-extremely-different-years-after-their-bitter-divo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./night-court-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./night-court-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html>Night Court Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lindsay-lohan-takes-topless-selfie-covers-breasts-with-hair.html>Lindsay Lohan Takes Topless Selfie, Covers Breasts With Hair</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lindsay-lohan-takes-topless-selfie-covers-breasts-with-hair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
