Until Major League Baseball installs some sort of hard salary cap system for rosters assuming that day will ever actually come, even average professional baseball players are paid millions upon millions of dollars per year because of the sport's current market. Those who are the best of the best at their positions make tens of millions of dollars guaranteed to them on a yearly basis, types of fortunes not seen in the National Hockey League or the National Football League.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starting pitchers are seen as the quarterbacks of their MLB squads, and thus it should come as no surprise to even casual fans that four pitchers top the list of the highest paid players in the league for 2015. One of those men is in the twilight of his career due to the wear and tear that his body has gone through during a lengthy and prosperous career, and there are some out there who believe that he should hang up his glove for good. Another is a proven winner who has, in the past, made headlines for some controversial pictures that involved the player and his famous supermodel girlfriend. Whoops.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two pitchers are tied at the mountaintop of baseball salaries for 2015. One has been to the summit of his profession in that he has twice been a World Series champion while with one of the more beloved teams in North American pro sports. The other is an individual who is widely perceived to be the best starting pitcher on the planet today, one who has also had some disappointing results to games during the month of October. His team is once again expected to be a postseason contender that could win it all once the fall arrives, and thus he will have additional opportunities to win multiple playoff games.</p><p><i><b>Values from <a href=#>Spotrac</a></b></i></p><h2 id=20-jacoby-ellsbury---new-york-yankees-21-142-857><b>20.

Of course they are, but the most popular and most hated team in Major League Baseball has the funds to do just that. <a title="Jacoby Ellsbury Net Worth" href=#>Ellsbury</a>'s best season to date came in 2011, and he has never again come close to flirting with posting such offensive statistics. Here is a fact that may surprise some of you out there: Ellsbury is, as it pertains to total cash included in the baseball contracts of the two players, set to make more money than is teammate <a title="Alex Rodriguez Net Worth" href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=19-jose-reyes---toronto-blue-jays-22-million><b>19.

There was just one problem: No such bids arose. Toronto will now be banking on <a title="Jose Reyes Net Worth" href=#>Reyes</a> turning the clock back, relocating the juice in his electric legs and being able to stay healthy for at least six straight months. Some have speculated that Reyes is not as content up north as he was when he was in the starting lineup for the Amazins. It should be easy for him to smile whenever he examines his bank account.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-masahiro-tanaka---new-york-yankees-22-million><b>18.

Tanaka won 13 of 20 starts for the Yanks, and he posted an ERA of 2.77 and an impressive WHIP of 1.06. The 26-year-old is on the verge of kicking off his first full season in the Big Leagues, and the Yankees have announced that Tanaka will be the team's Opening Day starter and, in theory, the ace pitcher for the club.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-miguel-cabrera---detroit-tigers-22-million><b>17. Miguel Cabrera - Detroit Tigers: $22 million</b></h2><p>Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Images</p><p>The first baseman who goes by the nickname “Miggy” is one reason why the Detroit Tigers have been the most consistent team in the American League Central division over the past several years. 2014 was somewhat of a down season for the slugger, as it was the first time he failed to post at least 30 regular season home runs since 2006. With that said, <a title="Miguel Cabrera Net Worth" href=#>Cabrera</a> did finish the campaign with 109 RBI, a batting average of .313 and an .OPS of .895. Cabrera has been one of the best offensive weapons of his generation, and the 31-year-old should still have plenty left in the tank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-hanley-ramirez---boston-red-sox-22-million><b>16.

Ramirez represents just one piece of what those running the Red Sox will hope to be the conclusion of the latest rebuilding process. Ramirez was one of the top gets of this past offseason, and the shortstop who has become an outfielder has reportedly relocated his smile upon putting pen to paper on his latest contract.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-cole-hamels---philadelphia-phillies-22-5-million><b>15.

It is bad times over at the Phillies, and the club is actively looking to dump players with high salaries and pick up who Philadelphia hope will be future stars via such trades. Hamels is just one name on the list of players being shopped by the club, and several teams are being linked with the starter. The favorites to get Hamels may be the Boston Red Sox, although the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees could also be in the running.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-mark-teixeira---new-york-yankees-22-5-million><b>14.

Even scouts have gone back-and-forth on whether or not the slugger is actually worth the large amounts of money the Yankees have invested in him. What cannot be debated is the fact that Teixeira has dealt with a laundry list of injury woes over the years, and critics would claim that he is “made of glass.” Teixeira stated during Spring Training that he was in the “best shape of his life.” That was before he suffered a knee knock during an exhibition game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-zack-greinke---los-angeles-dodgers-23-million><b>13.

He could, depending on how he performs throughout the 2015 regular season, be on the verge of making even more money in the near future. Greinke can opt out of his current contract next offseason, and doing so would likely lead to him netting an even larger yearly salary than what the Dodgers are currently paying him. Good work if you can get it.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-c-c-sabathia---new-york-yankees-23-million><b>12. C.C.

He and the New York Yankees are hoping that the additional pounds will help Sabathia remain healthy for the majority of the 2015 regular season. The 34-year-old who joined the Yankees back in 2009 and helped the club win a World Series that season will be looking to turn the clock back to the days of his physical prime when he was the best starting pitcher in all of the American League.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-josh-hamilton---los-angeles-angels-of-anaheim-23-million><b>11.

Hamilton and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are awaiting word of whatever punishment the player is going to receive following yet another drug and alcohol relapse. Not for nothing, but perhaps it is unwise and downright dangerous to strip away something that could provide structure and support to a man who could use the help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-joe-mauer---minnesota-twins-23-million><b>10.

That title run never occurred, the Twins have become one of the more forgettable sides in its own division, and Mauer is now serving the role as the scapegoat on a team that likely is not doing much of merit in 2015. Mauer may not deserve all of the criticisms he has received, but he could always theoretically dry his tears with all of the money the Twins have paid him.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-prince-fielder---texas-rangers-24-million><b>9.

Probably not, no, but Texas will be facing much bigger problems starting off in early April. The Rangers have holes throughout the roster, most notably in the team's rotation. It is for that reason that the Rangers are being linked with the previously mentioned Cole Hamels, although there are some who have speculated that Texas would not be able to finalize that deal for several reasons. The club is going to need <a title="Prince Fielder Net Worth" href=#>Fielder</a> to find the form that he enjoyed while with the Milwaukee Brewers to make his contract worth it.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-felix-hernandez---seattle-mariners-24-million><b>8.

Would you select anybody other than <a title="Felix Hernandez Net Worth" href=#>King Felix</a>? Corey Kluber of the Cleveland Indians unexpectedly had a banner season in 2014, but it is the Seattle Mariners starting pitcher who has proven his greatness time and time again. Hernandez could actually be a steal for the Mariners when you compare his contract to those possessed by the highest-paid pitchers in the league.

Those deals go down in every top-tier pro sport on the continent. Pujols has, when speaking with reporters during the spring, claimed that he is feeling more so like his old self, and the 35-year-old is, to his credit, swinging the bat well in preseason play.

Verlander has had somewhat of a difficult spring, during which he has struggled with lingering soreness in his triceps.

It was widely believed that Lester would rejoin the Red Sox after his contract expired at the end of the season, meaning that the Red Sox had basically traded Jonny Gomes for two good players. Nobody factored in the Chicago Cubs during those discussions, however, and the Cubs made Lester a very rich man upon stealing him away from Boston.

It seems unlikely he will ever make anything close to that amount of money per season as a professional athlete. Kershaw will make as high as $33 million in three seasons per the terms of his current deal, and he will also have the right to opt out of that contract after 2018.
