<time>16 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Branded content. Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>Yeah, we know – “best shampoos in the world” is a big claim, but we’re sure we’ve found them. Every single product on this list combines excellent ingredients with scientific roots, amazing results, and luxurious hair care experiences. Without a doubt, they’ve earned the title!</p><h2><strong>What Is Shampoo For?</strong></h2><p>A lot of stuff builds up on your hair and scalp throughout the day, and none of it’s good. Think sebum, dandruff, pollutants, dirt, dust, product residue – the list goes on. Shampoo exists to wash this buildup away, imparting benefits like increased softness, shine, and manageability. No matter your hair type or issue, there’s a shampoo out there that can give you the hair of your dreams. Shampoo is for banishing bad hair days!</p><h2><strong>What Makes a Great Shampoo?</strong></h2><p>A great shampoo is all about making your hair look and feel its best. Here are the elements to look for in a shampoo:</p><ul><li>Natural Ingredients: To get the best results and encourage healthy hair, you’ll want to stick to products with natural ingredients. Some of the best to look for include essential oils, aloe vera, and coconut-derived surfactants. These will clean your hair and give it an enviable glow without causing any damage.</li><li aria-level=1>No Toxins: When checking out the ingredient lists, it’s important not only to know what is in your shampoo but also what isn’t<i>. </i>Toxins like sulfates, parabens, silicone, formaldehyde, phthalates, and artificial dyes and fragrances are some of the worst offenders. These may strip your hair of essential moisture and irritate your scalp. Some even have additional negative health effects, so it’s best to steer clear of them.</li><li aria-level=1>Suits Your Hair Type: There are four hair types – straight, wavy, curly, and coily. Your hair care needs will vary depending on what kind of hair you have, so when looking for the right product try to find one that suits your hair type. Some shampoos state directly on the bottle what hair type they’re designed for.</li><li aria-level=1>A Pleasant Smell: Since scent lingers in your hair throughout the day, you want to look for a shampoo with a pleasant smell you’ll be happy to have around. Just try to avoid products with artificial fragrances, as that can be irritating to your skin.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Incorporate Shampoo Into Your Routine</strong></h2><p>The key to incorporating a great shampoo into your routine? Not using it every day! Experts recommend washing hair every two to three days to ensure that your hair is properly moisturized and not stripped of its natural oils.</p><p>Follow shampoo with conditioner for the best results, and use a hair oil before washing or styling to ensure moisture and shine. When styling, stay away from high heat and harmful chemical treatments. Your hair will thank you!</p><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Shampoo</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image23-11.png alt="Blu Atlas Shampoo" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Best shampoo in the world is quite a title, and it’s one that Blu Atlas shampoo absolutely deserves.
