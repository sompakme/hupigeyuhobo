The actress has been on bad terms with Brad since 2016, and only recently went into detail about the abuse allegations she suffered.With reason to heed a relationship with Brad, some fans wonder if Angelina got involved with Emily, causing the model to break things up so abruptly. Here’s what we know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-may-not-even-be-on-speaking-terms>Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie May Not Even Be On Speaking Terms</h2><p>Brad and Angelina once seemed like the most solid couple in Hollywood. After over a decade together (and six children), the pair married in 2014 at Château Miraval, the family's estate in the French village of Correns – <a href=#>the winery that’s now the center of a huge lawsuit between the exes</a>.</p><p>However, Angelina filed for divorce in 2016 after a dramatic incident that reportedly took place on a private plane. Reports at the time said Brad got physical with Angelina and their kids. The FBI launched an investigation following the incident, but Brad was cleared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, he’s remained on bad terms with Angelina since their split. In 2017, it was reported Brad and Angelina weren’t on speaking terms. Though sources said they were communicating again months later.</p><p>“ <a href=#>They are in a place where</a> they can put anger or hurt aside to focus on their children and how they plan to coparent,” a source said at the time. “They are only speaking about the kids but have agreed that the kids’ best interest comes first and that they will be civil to one another.”</p><p>Still, Brad and Angelina’s conflict has continued beyond their divorce. The two have been engaged in a years-long custody battle for their minor kids, with Brad alleging that Angelina has intentionally been trying to keep him away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The exes have also been engaged in a legal battle over shares in their winery estate. Angelina eventually sold her investment to a Russian businessman, which Brad later alleged was a move to harm his reputation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Celebrities Swear They’re Never Going To Have Kids</a></span></p><p>Brad has sued her over selling her shares, while Angelina and her company have launched their own cases over what they say is his harassment.</p><p>With this in mind, it’s unlikely that Brad and Angelina communicate beyond what’s necessary. So, the idea of her reaching out to his girlfriend (especially a new one) seems far-fetched. With no evidence to suggest Angie ever reached out to Emily, there’s no reason to assume they’ve talked about the model’s relationship with Brad.</p><h2 id=emily-ratajkowski-allegedly-ended-things-with-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-wasn-t-involved>Emily Ratajkowski Allegedly Ended Things With Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Wasn't Involved</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if Angelina was thinking of reaching out, she didn’t have much of a chance. Brad’s fling with Emily was short-lived. They were first linked in September, the same month it was reported that Emily had filed for divorce from her husband, Sebastian Bear McClard-, amid rumors of infidelity.</p><p>A source at the time says the pair are just "having fun,” and that Emily was avoiding anything serious amid her divorce.</p><p>"The split was very rough for her," they continued. "It was unexpected and devastating […] which is why her dalliance with Pitt, whom she met through mutual friends, according to insiders, is so sweet right now. "It's the perfect timing right now. There is nothing like Brad Pitt cheering you up.”</p><p>The insider added, “She wants to get to know him better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, things took a quick turn when Emily was photographed kissing another man, which appeared to confirm her romance with Brad was over. Sources say Brad was surprised by the split, which was Emily’s decision. “<a href=#>He’s not used to being dumped or snubbed</a>, but that’s the grim reality of what’s happened,” a source said.</p><p>“[Brad] was telling everyone how incredible Emily Ratajkowski was, that he saw the long-term potential and couldn’t wait to spend more time and get to know her better,” they continued. “All of a sudden she’s stepped out with this other guy and doesn’t seem to give a rat’s butt about Brad.”</p><p>The source called it a “huge blow to his ego” and a “real kick in the teeth.”</p><h2 id=both-brad-pitt-amp-emily-ratajkowski-have-moved-on-with-new-people>Both Brad Pitt & Emily Ratajkowski Have Moved On With New People</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Brad and Emily appear to be moving on from their romance quickly, as they're dating new people, Brad has reportedly been <a href=#>seeing Ines de Ramon for a few months</a> (though sources say it's not exclusive), while Emily is now dating Pete Davidson.
