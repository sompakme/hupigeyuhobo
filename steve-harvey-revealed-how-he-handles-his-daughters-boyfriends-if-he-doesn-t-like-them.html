"You can think a person is wonderful, but everybody's wonderful in the beginning. Everybody, you always meet the mask," he said. "The mask can last for about 90 days, and then after a while, the mask starts unraveling, and I just try to wait on that period. Sometimes they make it, sometimes they don't."</p><p>"But if you come in the house, and I know right off the top that you're just not a good guy, I start the reading process right away," he shared. "I don't say nothing to my daughter, I just, behind the scenes, I start working toward getting rid of this guy." <strong>His approach to his daughters' dating indicates how much Harvey cares about who they associate with, and he is a protective dad</strong>. He may not be the easiest guy to impress, but his actions do come from love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The person you choose to spend your life with is probably the most important decision you'll ever make," he said. "That relationship becomes an elevator. It can take you up, or it can take you down, so choose wisely." <strong>Harvey knows what he is talking about, and while his first marriage to Marcia Harvey did not work out, he and Marjorie Harvey have been married since 2007</strong>.</p><h2 id=what-has-lori-harvey-said-about-her-dad-approving-her-partners>What Has Lori Harvey Said About Her Dad Approving Her Partners?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lori-harvey.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steve Harvey's daughter Lori Harvey has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some high-profile romances</a>, including Damson Idris (Idris Elba's son), Michael B.

He said he would respect his daughter's privacy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refusing to talk about her personal life</a>.

I've given her advice quite a few times, but you know, it's difficult 'cause she's 25," he continued. "She's growing up as a public figure. She doesn't get to make her mistakes like everybody else.
