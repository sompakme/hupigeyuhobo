Despite his successful career, which earned him a Best Actor Oscar at the 2005 Academy Awards, Jamie's love life has had its ups and downs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, just one year after divorcing her husband, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes was believed to be romancing Jamie. While their relationship was kept out of the limelight as much as possible, the media eventually found out that they were, in fact, dating. The two reportedly shared an on-again, off-again romance for six years before calling it quits. During those six years, plenty of rumors circulated regarding the former couple's relationship.</p><p>Here are 15 rumors Jamie Foxx wishes would quietly disappear.</p><h2 id=he-allegedly-stole-katie-holmes-from-her-ex-husband><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Allegedly 'Stole' Katie Holmes From Her Ex-Husband</span></h2><p>When dating rumors about Jamie and Katie first surfaced in August 2013, there was gossip that Foxx “stole” the actress from Tom Cruise. It’s a pretty silly allegation, given that Katie had already filed for divorce from her ex. However, Jamie was deemed a family friend of Tom and Katie, so the fact that he ended up dating her made things pretty awkward. It certainly gave the impression that Jamie may have had a thing for Katie before she filed for divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-allegedly-feuding-with-tom-cruise-over-his-relationship-with-katie><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He Was Allegedly Feuding With Tom Cruise Over His Relationship With Katie</span></h2><p>When it was first claimed that Jamie and Katie were dating, many wondered what had happened to the Django Unchained star’s friendship with Tom. They were said to have been pretty close, but it’s fair to assume that they lost contact when Jamie romanced Katie. Needless to say, they certainly didn’t remain pals.</p><h2 id=he-allegedly-replaced-tom-as-suri-s-father-figure><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He&nbsp;Allegedly Replaced Tom As Suri’s Father Figure</span></h2><p>In April 2019, tabloid magazine, Grazia, claimed that Katie Holmes wanted to make Jamie Foxx a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">father figure to daughter Suri</a>&nbsp;since Tom Cruise was no longer part of her life. Before their split, sources told the mag that Jamie was close with Suri but he was reluctant to be photographed with her out of respect for Tom Cruise.</p><h2 id=he-allegedly-broke-up-with-katie-to-date-other-women><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Allegedly Broke Up With Katie To Date Other Women</span></h2><p>Throughout their time together, it was rumored that Jamie Foxx broke up with Katie on numerous occasions - the breakups were allegedly due to the 'fact' that he wanted to be free and see other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2019, the National Enquirer<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>: “Jamie can’t control himself. He’s still attracted to Katie, but there’s no way he wants to get serious with her and stop seeing other hot chicks.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About The Rezvani Military Tank (That Weird Car Jamie Foxx Drives)</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-allegedly-dating-kate-beckinsale-at-one-point><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Was Allegedly Dating Kate Beckinsale At One Point</span></h2><p>Katie and Jamie supposedly shared an on-again, off-again relationship for almost six years. During that time, when things had cooled down between the two, Foxx was romantically linked to another actress, Kate Beckinsale. Their respective camps never confirmed or denied the claims, but given his track record with the ladies, perhaps Jamie did have a brief fling with the gorgeous brunette.</p><h2 id=he-allegedly-bought-a-house-for-his-ex-girlfriend-while-dating-katie><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Allegedly Bought A House For His Ex-Girlfriend While Dating Katie</span></h2><p>The National Enquirer was coming up with all sorts of rumors concerning Jamie Foxx’s private life. Last year, the publication claimed that Jamie had bought his ex-girlfriend, Kristin Grannis, an expensive home while being in a committed relationship with Katie. The rumor was shut down by Jamie’s rep, who claimed there was absolutely no truth to the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-denied-assaulting-a-woman-in-2002><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Denied Assaulting A Woman In 2002</span></h2><p>In June 2018, Jamie Foxx denied claims that he assaulted a woman during an altercation that happened back in 2002. His lawyer, Allison Hart,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed in a statement</a>: “Jamie emphatically denies that this incident ever occurred, and he will be filing a report with the Las Vegas Police Department against the woman for filing a false police report against him.”</p><h2 id=he-was-allegedly-dating-a-woman-30-years-younger-than-him><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Was Allegedly Dating A Woman 30 Years Younger Than Him</span></h2><p>In November 2019, Jamie Foxx was rumored to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating his protege</a>, Sela Vave, but what made the story so scandalous was that the aspiring singer is 30 YEARS younger than him.</p><p>In response to the rumors, Jamie said: “We wanted to treat her the same way and give her the opportunity. I spoke to that girl’s mom and she put her trust in me. We don’t ever cross lines like that, personal. I wanted to let you know, for all who were scandal chasing, that’s our artist, that’s our family… We are working.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Facts About Jamie Foxx’s Relationship With Daughter, Annalise</a></span></p><h2 id=katie-allegedly-demanded-jamie-get-her-pregnant><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Katie Allegedly Demanded Jamie Get Her Pregnant</span></h2><p>According to the National Enquirer, Katie demanded that Jamie Foxx get her pregnant or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was going to call it quits</a> on their relationship. The absurd rumor continued with an insider telling the news outlet: “Katie wants to move to the next stage of their relationship and be pregnant by early 2020 at the latest.”</p><h2 id=he-leaked-his-personal-photos-for-publicity><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He ‘Leaked’ His Personal Photos For Publicity</span></h2><p>In August 2009, a personal photo of Jamie Foxx’s private area surfaced online, and while fans initially doubted that the pic was real, the father-of-one later revealed how disappointed he was to have his privacy invaded in such a terrible manner. Others claimed that Jamie purposely leaked the explicit photo to promote his movie, Law Abiding Citizen, which was released just two months after the scandal. Could it have been a coincidence?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-allegedly-tried-to-repair-his-friendship-with-tom><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Allegedly Tried To Repair His Friendship With Tom</span></h2><p>Though they aren’t believed to be the best of friends anymore, Jamie and Tom Cruise are said to be cordial with one another. According to Naughty Gossip, the two were able to overcome their differences following the news that Foxx had romanced Tom’s ex-wife just months after their divorce. “It wasn’t pretty, but now Tom and Jamie are mending their broken relationship,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source explained</a>.</p><h2 id=he-had-a-hair-transplant><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Had A Hair Transplant</span></h2><p>It’s been rumored for years that Jamie Foxx underwent a hair transplant procedure right after starring in 2012’s Django Unchained. The contrast is rather noticeable when looking at his movies from 2013 and onwards, but Jamie never addressed matters concerning his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new and improved hairline</a>. Still, when looking at before and after photos, you can see the difference.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Jamie Foxx’s Daughter, Corinne</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quentin-tarantino-initially-didn-t-like-his-performance-in-django-unchained><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Quentin Tarantino Initially Didn’t Like His Performance In ‘Django Unchained’</span></h2><p>Quentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers in the world, but some actors who’ve previously worked with him have complained about his way of handling things on the set. During an interview with Howard Stern in 2017, Jamie recalled how he was yelled at by Tarantino.</p><p>"He was a tyrant, like: 'Do not f*** my film up.’ But that's what you want. You want a director who, even if you're going off the cliff, you know that you're going off the f****** cliff."</p><p>Despite being told off by Quentin, Jamie said he had a pleasant experience working with the 56-year-old and suggested he would sign up for another project of his in a heartbeat.</p><h2 id=he-made-a-transphobic-joke><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Made A Transphobic Joke</span></h2><p>Jamie got himself into a lot of trouble when he made several transphobic jokes about Caitlyn Jenner’s transition. In his opening monologue at a stand-up show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie joked</a>: "We have some groundbreaking performances here, too, tonight. We got Bruce Jenner, who will be here doing some musical performances. He's doing a his-and-her duet all by himself." Many people were given the impression that the 52-year-old was transphobic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-allegedly-underwent-cosmetic-surgery-after-their-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Katie Holmes Allegedly Underwent Cosmetic Surgery After Their Split</span></h2><p>In September 2019, the NW claimed that Katie went under the knife on several occasions following her most recent split with Jamie. Sources <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told the publication</a>: “It looks like she’s had a facelift, lip fillers and probably Botox of the forehead, between the eyebrows and the crow’s feet.
