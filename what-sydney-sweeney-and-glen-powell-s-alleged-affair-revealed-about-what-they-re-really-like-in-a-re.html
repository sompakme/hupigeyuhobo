But it wouldn't exactly be surprising if Davino stuck around Sweeney due to all of the romance rumors she's had with her co-stars.

The hot, blonde stars were far away in Sydney, Australia with their then-partners back home. According to The Daily Mail, <strong>Sydney Sweeney's much older fiance Jonathan Davino</strong> was back in Los Angeles taking care of her dog, Tank.</p><p>Powell's then-girlfriend, Gigi Paris, did come down to the set but broke up with the Top Gun: Maverick star soon after. This is one of the many reasons why <a href=#>fans aren't convinced that nothing happened between Sweeney and Powell.</a> However, according to People,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Paris and Powell had an on-and-off relationship</a> long before Sweeney was cast as his love interest in Anyone But You. But the rumors were given more legitimacy after Paris unfollowed Sweeney on Instagram before her breakup with Powell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, both actors have denied any romantic involvement with one another.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sydney-sweeney-s-fianc-jonathan-davino-may-be-richer-than-she-is-despite-no-one-knowing-a-thing-about-him.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Sydney Sweeney And Jonathan Davino's Relationship Is Really Like: Here's The Truth About Dating The Euphoria Star</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There's no shortage of fans who want to know what it's like to date Sydney Sweeney; here's what we know based on her relationship with her fiance.</span><p>While it's unknown exactly <strong>what Gigi Paris thought of her then-boyfriend's relationship with Sweeney</strong>, it's not unlikely that their steamy chemistry contributed to their breakup.</p><p>Sweeney's fiance, on the other hand, has said absolutely nothing about it (or anything) to the press. But he did appear by her side soon after at The Venice Film Festival. It was one of the first times he walked arm-in-arm with her.

This was something the stars didn't hide on the set of their movie. Not only did behind-the-scenes images from the shoot depict their close connection, but they also posted images of each other on their Instagram.</p><p>The most controversial involved Sweeney sitting on Powell's lap as he dipped her. This was in addition to images of Sweeney spending close and personal time with Powell on the top of a bus and at the Toronga Zoo with the entirety of his Australian family. According to The Daily Mail, extras on set believed they were actually a couple off-set due to their close connection.</p><p>Anonymous tips to Deux Moi also suggested the two were romantically involved. But the only evidence of that are images of them being platonically affectionate with one another. Still, both of their romantic partners had to understand that Sweeney and Powell weren't going to swear off close connections with the opposite sex despite them being romantically taken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell-flirt-with-each-other-on-instagram><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sydney Sweeney And Glen Powell Flirt With Each Other On Instagram</span></h2><h3 id=sydney-sweeney-39-s-instagram-followers-15-8-million-as-of-november-2023>Sydney Sweeney's Instagram Followers: 15.8 Million As Of November 2023</h3><h3 id=glen-powell-39-s-instagram-followers-894k-as-of-november-2023>Glen Powell's Instagram Followers: 894K As Of November 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_sydney-sweeney-s-body-transformation-changed-her-life_bk_a2.jpg><p>If you're going to date either Sydney Sweeney or Glen Powell it's clear that you have to be okay with the fact that they are going to get a little flirty with other people.
