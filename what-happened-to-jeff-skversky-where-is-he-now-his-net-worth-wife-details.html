Let us learn about him from this article.</strong></p><p>Jeff Skversky obtained his first job out of college with a television station in Macon, Georgia, but it fell through by the time he arrived. As a result, he relocated to Atlantic City to work as a sportscaster for WMGM-TV.</p><p>Jeff then moved to St Louis in March 2006 to work at KMOV-TV, where he worked until June 2008, when the station’s sports departments were forced to close due to the recession.</p><p>In addition, Jeff is a huge baseball fan who cheers on the Philadelphia Phillies.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="What Happened To Jeff Skversky?">What Happened To Jeff Skversky?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Jeff Skversky Net Worth: Where Is He Now?">Jeff Skversky Net Worth: Where Is He Now?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Is Jeff Skversky Married? – His Wife">Is Jeff Skversky Married? – His Wife</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Meet Jeff Skversky On Twitter">Meet Jeff Skversky On Twitter</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-jeff-skversky></span>What Happened To Jeff Skversky?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A source alerted us earlier this week that Jeff Skversky is no longer employed at Action News. Skversky’s bio has been taken from the WPVI website, according to our low-level research.</p><p>For that kind of thing, TV stations don’t send out press releases, and the star in question usually just says something on Twitter, but Jeff hasn’t said anything. The radio-quiet is a little strange.</p><p>Jeff interned at WPVI-TV, which was branded on-air as 6 ABC, before being hired as a full-time anchor. It is a television station owned and operated by ABC and licensed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the United States.</p><p>The Walt Disney Company’s ABC Owned Television Stations subsidiary owns the station.

His responsibilities at the station include anchoring sportscasts and covering the Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Sixers, as well as various college and high school sports.</p><p>As of 2022, Jeff appears to be living with his wife and only child in Philadelphia, PA.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jeff-skversky-married-%e2%80%93-his-wife></span>Is Jeff Skversky Married? – His Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeff Skversky is married to his beautiful wife, Mandy Lam.
