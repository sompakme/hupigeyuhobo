While any loss is sad to hear, this one seemed to strike wrestling fans especially hard given a general sense of Vince himself being immortal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A chorus of condolences came through, but Ryback took a different tack, tweeting that Vince had “an insatiable urge to have control. He had no control watching his mom get beat up as a child, which is a horrendous thing for a kid to witness, as their [expletive] mom tries to make ends meet. Vince has failed to evolve. [Expletive] you old man.” While the WWE Chairman has his share of critics, everyone seemed to agree Ryback’s comments at that moment were repugnant.</p><h2 id=didn-rsquo-t-seem-to-understand-karma-as-it-pertained-to-cm-punk-rsquo-s-injury><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Didn’t Seem To Understand Karma As It Pertained To CM Punk’s Injury</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CM-Punk-gives-up-AEW-Title.jpg><p>After CM Punk left WWE, he was open in his critique of Ryback, including accusing The Big Guy of being reckless in the ring and injuring him. Years later, Punk had to relinquish the AEW Championship mere days after winning it, opening up huge questions about <a href=#>who would hold AEW's top title in his absence</a>, besides marking a huge hit on Punk personally.

The Game opened up about the situation leading up to WrestleMania 38 weekend, revealing how close he’d come to death and officially announced his retirement from the ring. While many <a href=#>voices emerged to celebrate Triple H’s legacy</a>, Ryback was not among them. Rather, Ryback tweeted, “"You ended up being the biggest disappointment for me personally from loving you growing up, but I wish you well in retirement and future good health.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it’s fair for Ryback not to have the most positive impression of The Cerebral Assassin, going out of his way to bash him at this particular time felt as though it was in terrible taste.</p><h2 id=blasted-mark-henry-rsquo-s-ring-work><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Blasted Mark Henry’s Ring Work</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ryback-vs-mark-henry-wrestlemania-29.jpg><p>Ryback and Mark Henry worked a memorable feud that included one of the <a href=#>better good big man vs. big man showdowns</a> at WrestleMania 29. In 2021, the two engaged in a war of words over social media. That included Ryback suggesting Henry was “the [expletive]s in the ring,” and that’s why John Cena didn’t want to work house shows with him, so Ryback stepped up.</p><p>Henry continued the exchange via Busted Open Radio, which got the point of each man speculating about what would happen in a real fight between the two of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claims-he-gave-the-shield-the-idea-for-their-signature-move><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Claims He Gave The Shield The Idea For Their Signature Move</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Shield-vs-Ryback--Team-Hell-No.jpg><p>When The Shield first arrived on the scene in WWE, they made their presence known by helping reigning WWE Champion CM Punk retain his title against Ryback. The trio of fresh faces hit a triple powerbomb on The Big Guy and years later, on his podcast, Ryback claimed he actually gave them the idea for the move.</p><p>Ryback was actually a bit tongue-in-cheek in joking afterward that he regretted bringing up the idea, given he was the one who had to take the bump off it more than anyone in the months to follow.</p><h2 id=said-he-could-manhandle-brock-lesnar><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Said He Could Manhandle Brock Lesnar</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Triple-H-Vs-Brock-Lesnar.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryback is enough of a powerhouse that most people wouldn’t dare start a physical altercation with him. Brock Lesnar is one of the very few men, however, who by virtue of size and pedigree in MMA and amateur wrestling whom most fans would favor to take The Big Guy in a legitimate fight.</p><p>However, Ryback didn’t seem so sure when he took to Twitter in the fall of 2021 to claim he “could manhandle [Lesnar] with ease in every way possible.” It’s impossible to say if Ryback was simply trying to stir the pot or actually saying what he believes, but regardless he drew his share of dissenting opinions given how <a href=#>few people believably could beat Lesnar in a real fight</a>.</p><h2 id=defended-the-undertaker-rsquo-s-least-popular-comments><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Defended The Undertaker’s Least Popular Comments</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Undertaker-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While The Undertaker is one of the best respected figures in professional wrestling, he drew the ire of a number of people in the business for comments he made on Joe Rogan’s podcast. In particular, The Dead Man suggested that current wrestling had gone soft.</p><p>While Ryback typically wouldn’t draw any heat for agreeing with The Undertaker, in this case, when he called the show a great listen and paid tribute to the wrestlers that came before, it didn’t come across so well, for the suggestion he agreed contemporary wrestlers don’t have enough edge to them.</p><h2 id=claimed-vince-mcmahon-purposefully-hurt-his-merchandise-sales><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Claimed Vince McMahon Purposefully Hurt His Merchandise Sales</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ryback-In-His-Merchandise.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In more than one instance on his podcast and Twitter, Ryback has come around to the theme of Vince McMahon and others in WWE management sabotaging him. One recurrent thread is the idea they purposefully undermined his merchandise sales by turning him heel or cutting off his pushes each time he started to catch fire.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Hilarious Pieces Of Wrestling Merchandise We Can't Believe Exist</a></span></p><p>While the quality of WWE booking is certainly up for debate, the idea the head of company went out of his way to counterintuitively hurt a rising star’s ability to generate revenue feels unusual to say the least.</p><h2 id=said-his-greatest-moment-was-getting-out-of-wwe><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Said His Greatest Moment Was Getting Out Of WWE</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kevin-Owens-v-Ryback-Hell-in-a-Cell-2015-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a 2020 visit to The Angle podcast, Ryback delved into a range of issues from his WWE career. The interview included chronicling his time working with Paul Heyman and with Curtis Axel as a tag team partner, but arrived at its crux in The Big Guy claiming his greatest moment of all was when he left the company.</p><p>Ryback’s certainly not alone in <a href=#>expressing discontent with his WWE tenure</a>. However, for a wrestler who hasn’t enjoyed success elsewhere and did have the spotlight for key swathes of time, his expression of how great it was to leave felt a little overstated and perhaps like sour grapes for not fully realizing the potential he thought he had.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmedpMC1ec6uq6WZnpm2tLSMq6CdoZOqubDB0maaqKakp7y3sdGsoJqkXam1qrrGrGSrsZKWsKx5xK%2Bcq2WjlraledawnGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-outlandish-things-ryback-ever-said.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vanessa-bryant-declares-justice-for-kobe-gigi-after-trial-win.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vanessa-bryant-declares-justice-for-kobe-gigi-after-trial-win.html>Vanessa Bryant Declares 'Justice' for Kobe, Gigi After Trial Win</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-nicole-earnhardt-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-husband-career-and-net-worth.html>Taylor Nicole Earnhardt Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Parents, Husband, Career and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-nicole-earnhardt-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-husband-career-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
