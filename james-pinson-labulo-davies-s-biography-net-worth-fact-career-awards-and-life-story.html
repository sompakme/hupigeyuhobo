His parents were recaptive Yoruba people liberated by the British West Africa Squadron from the Atlantic Slave Trade, and whose origins were in Abeokuta and Ogbomoso respectively.</p><p>Davies entered the Church Missionary Society (CMS) Grammar School, (now known as Sierra Leone Grammar School), in Freetown in 1848, where he studied mathematics, Greek, biblical and English history, geography, music, and Latin. After completing his secondary education, he became a teacher with the CMS in Freetown. After his stint as a teacher Davies enlisted as a cadet with the British Royal Navy’s West Africa Squadron, and served on HMS&nbsp;Volcano under Commander Robert Coote where he was trained in navigation and seamanship. Davies progressed from cadet to midshipman and eventually lieutenant.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=participation-in-the-lagos-bombardment-of-1851-and-merchant-vessel-career></span>Participation in the Lagos Bombardment of 1851 and merchant vessel career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Davies was a lieutenant aboard HMS&nbsp;Bloodhound during the Bombardment of Lagos under the command of Commander Wilmot and Commodore Henry William Bruce and in which Oba Kosoko was ousted, resulting in the ascension of Oba Akitoye. During the bombardment the British Navy lost two officers and ten men were wounded. Lieutenant Davies was among the wounded. Davies retired from the navy in 1852 and offered his services as a merchant vessel captain traversing the West African coast. He eventually settled in Lagos in 1856, where he became known as “Captain J.P.L Davies”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life-and-marriages></span>Personal life and marriages<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Davies was first married to Matilda Bonifacio Serrano, a Spanish lady from Havana, who died in 1860, nine months after their marriage. In August 1862, Davies married Sara Forbes Bonetta, a protegée of Queen Victoria. Sarah Forbes Bonetta, originally named Princess Aina, was a slave freed by Captain Forbes of the Bonetta after a meeting with King Ghezo of Dahomey. (Aina’s village in Okeadan was raided by Dahomean warriors who killed her parents, West African royalty, when she was five; she became a slave in King Ghezo’s court.) Sarah died of tuberculosis in 1880, and Davies married Catherine Kofoworola Reffle in 1889.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cocoa-farming-pioneer-in-west-africa></span>Cocoa farming pioneer in West Africa<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Davies is credited with pioneering cocoa farming in west Africa after obtaining the cocoa seeds from a Brazilian ship and also from the island of Fernando Po in 1879 and 1880. Davies subsequently established a prosperous cocoa farm in Ijon, Western Lagos. Davies also helped spread cocoa farming knowledge to Jacob Kehinde Coker, who used the proceeds from his cocoa farm to support Christian evangelical interests. J.K Coker also headed the Agege Planters Union, which spread the cocoa throughout Yoruba territory. In April 1916, The Journal of African Society credited a native of Accra with introducing cocoa to mainland West Africa, but Justice W.B. Griffiths, colonial Chief Justice of Gold Coast (present day Ghana), issued a rebuttal in the June 20, 1916 edition of the crediting his father, Sir Brandford Griffiths, the British governor of Gold Coast from 1885–1895, with pioneering cocoa farming in Gold Coast, noting that Davies predated his father as the cocoa pioneer in West Africa. Justice Griffith wrote:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><i>As far as I’m aware, the first person to plant cocoa on the main-land was the late Capt. J.P.L. Davies, a well known native of Lagos, who in 1882 used to tell me about the farm he had lately just made beyond the Protectorate of Lagos.</i></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=philanthropy-and-establishment-of-cms-grammar-school></span>Philanthropy and establishment of CMS Grammar School<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Davies was also a close associate and friend of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther. Both men collaborated on a couple of Lagos social initiatives such as the opening of The Academy (a social and cultural center for public enlightenment) on 24 October 1866 with Bishop Crowther as the first patron and Davies as its first president.</p><p>In April 1859 Davies provided Reverend Thomas Babington Macaulay with the seed funding to establish the CMS Grammar School, Lagos: £50 (purchasing power of ₦1.34 million as of 2014) to buy books and equipment. With the seed funds, Macaulay opened CMS Grammar School on 6 June 1859.</p><p>In 1867, Davies contributed another £100 (purchasing power of ₦2.68 million as of 2014) toward a CMS Grammar School Building Fund. Other contributors to the CMS building fund were non-Saros such as Daniel Conrad Taiwo, AKA Taiwo Olowo, who contributed £50. Saro contributors also included men such as Moses Johnson, I.H. Willoughby, T.F. Cole, James George, and Charles Foresythe who contributed £40.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=death></span>Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Captain Davies died at his Lagos home on 29 August 1906 and was buried at Ajele Cemetery in Lagos on 30 August 1906.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn66usdJmp6Kmo6S7brjAm6ylp12Zrre1xKxkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJ%2BZk6l6pK3RnpyrZZGsrrOw0malnqxdrLyzwMdmmKecXaG2p7GMrKuoqqlk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-pinson-labulo-davies-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leah-remini-reveals-estranged-dad-died-weeks-ago.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leah-remini-reveals-estranged-dad-died-weeks-ago.html>Leah Remini Reveals Estranged Dad Died Weeks Ago</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-do-jenny-and-dave-marrs-earn-details-about-their-net-worth-and-kids.html>How Much Do Jenny And Dave Marrs Earn?
