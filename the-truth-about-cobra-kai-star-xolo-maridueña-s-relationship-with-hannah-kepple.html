His fame increased after starring as the All Valley karate champion, but there's still so much that people want to know about him. For example, how he prepared himself for playing Miguel on the series. From the show, fans can tell that he's very athletic. But the truth is <a href=#>Xolo has been acting professionally since he was 10 years old</a>. The actor used to play basketball and tennis, and he even did Shotokan karate for a year when he was younger. He trained intensely for the role of Miguel. As proof of it, Xolo spent two to four hours every day in stunts, martial arts, boxing, strength, and yoga.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regarding his love life, Xolo dated one of his Cobra Kai co-stars. But it's not the girl everyone thinks. Fans loved to see him with Mary Mouser, who plays his love interest, Samantha LaRusso. <a href=#>The actress amazed everyone away with her amazing portrayal of Samantha</a>. Nevertheless, Xolo dated Hannah Kepple, the actress who plays Moon. They started dating in 2019 after the filming of season two, and they posted a bunch of cute photos and videos together. However, there are no recent photos of them, and the actor has said in an interview that he's single. Here is the truth about what happened between Xolo Maridueña and Hannah Kepple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-xolo-maridue-ntilde-a-and-his-39-cobra-kai-39-co-star-hannah-kepple>What Happened Between Xolo Maridueña and His 'Cobra Kai' Co-Star Hannah Kepple?</h2><p>Being a martial arts drama, Cobra Kai has many intense fight scenes, but there are also many epic romances and broken hearts in the show. It's no surprise that fans are curious about the cast's off-screen love lives. Although some fans shipped Xolo Maridueña and Mary Mouser, their relationship seems platonic. In fact, Xolo still enjoys teasing Mouser about their first on-screen kiss. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Netflix</a>, Xolo hilariously describes the kiss scene between him and Mouser: "So I'm over here, shoveling packets of gum in my mouth, Listerine strips are constantly in rotation … so I lean in to the kiss, only to hear the best words one could hear when you are about to kiss your co-star. Mary, very silently and very timidly, says: 'Xolo, I'm nervous, you're like a brother to me.'" Clearly, they're best friends. It turns out Xolo had his eye on another co-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Ralph Macchio Really Made 'Cobra Kai'</a></span></p><p>After the first season wrapped, Xolo started dating Hannah Kepple. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kepple confirmed their romance after the season two premiere</a>. She said, "Season 1, we were actually friends, a little flirty, and then we started talking after season 1, and it clicked." Unfortunately, it looks like the pair might have called it quits. Both Maridueña and Kepple's social media accounts used to be a storybook of their relationship. However, sometime toward the end of 2021, all their photos together were deleted.</p><h2 id=xolo-maridue-ntilde-a-39-s-approach-to-dating-in-general>Xolo Maridueña's Approach to Dating in General</h2><p>Maridueña and his close friend Jacob Bertrand aka Hawk, recently launched a podcast. In one episode, Xolo admitted that he doesn't think sending a stranger message on social media is a great way to start a relationship. The actor said, "It seems like you're already starting on a weird foot." In addition, Maridueña revealed that he'd had three serious girlfriends so far. The young actor also said one of them reached out to him online. Fans must be wondering, what about Xolo's real-life friend, Jacob Bertrand? Does he have more luck than his character?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Cobra Kai' Went Too Far When Filming This Scene In Terrible Conditions</a></span></p><h2 id=the-love-life-of-jacob-bertrand-from-39-cobra-kai-39>The Love Life of Jacob Bertrand From 'Cobra Kai'</h2><p>Jacob Bertrand is dating Serena Pullen. The couple has been together for almost five years. Two years ago, he wished her a happy birthday on his Instagram, writing, "Thanks for loving me. Every version, red hair, blue, pink, bleached, and brown. Love ya." He often posted of her, expressing how much he misses her. But, some fans are paranoid and think they might have broken up. In response to Jacob's post captioned "missing my love," many fans wanted to know if they're still together. One comment suggests not and accused Serena of cheating. However, there's absolutely no proof of this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his friend Xolo, Jacob revealed that he's never used dating apps and doesn't intend to. He does enjoy hopping in his friend's Tinder to help them find matches through, but the 21-year-old actor admitted he's only dated people he's met in person. Bertrand doesn't enjoy the texting phase of new relationships because he has to be witty the whole time, and it's exhausting. Instead, Jacob believes growing a connection with someone is sharing experiences, which isn't easy over text.</p><h2 id=who-is-39-karate-kid-39-star-ralph-macchio-married-to-in-real-life>Who Is 'Karate Kid' Star Ralph Macchio Married to in Real Life?</h2><p>It's been 36 years since Ralph Macchio first played Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai's predecessor Karate Kid. He's been married for nearly as long: 34 years and going strong. The 60-year-old actor has the most wholesome love story people have heard in ages. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He first laid eyes on his wife, Phyllis Fierro, when he was 15</a>. They tied the knot in their late twenties and have two beautiful children together. Their eldest, Julia, is an actress while the youngest, Daniel, is an actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> What Has Peyton List Said About Learning Karate For Her Role As Tory On 'Cobra Kai'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikop%2Blmrlur86bqZplm5a2bsTOpaZmpZGntqXBxKeYZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lmJa7r63HZqKeqKChsm5%2Bj2tpaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-cobra-kai-star-xolo-maridue%25C3%25B1a-s-relationship-with-hannah-kepple.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./this-dark-spot-serum-has-changed-the-lives-of-over-4-000-shoppers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./this-dark-spot-serum-has-changed-the-lives-of-over-4-000-shoppers.html>This Dark Spot Serum Has Changed the Lives of Over 4,000 Shoppers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-life-of-famous-american-actress-and-model-brigette-lundy-paine.html>The Life of Famous American Actress and Model Brigette Lundy-Paine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-life-of-famous-american-actress-and-model-brigette-lundy-paine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
