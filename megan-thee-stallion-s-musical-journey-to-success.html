Her musical journey to success is one of a kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, better known as Megan Thee Stallion, <a href=#>is an American rapper</a> and songwriter. She is also addressed as Tina Snow, Meg Thee Stallion, Hot Girl Coach, and Hot Girl Meg for her striking compositions on body positivity and <a href=#>empowerment of Black Women.</a></p><h2 id=the-discovery-of-skills>The Discovery of Skills</h2><p>Megan was born in 1995 in San Antonio, Texas. She got inspired to become a rapper at a very young age as her mother was also a rapper. Holly Aleece Thomas had a six-year-long rapping career, and it was enough to inspire Megan to discover the same talent in herself. Megan often claims that she started composing rap songs from the tender age of 7. However, she was a shy kid and not ready to tell people that she could rap for a considerable time.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan joined</a> Texas Southern University to enroll in a health administration course. Being a firm spokesperson for women empowerment, she decided to master the art and hone her talents to represent her community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once she started <a href=#>making and distributing raps</a> on the campus, Megan gathered the courage to reveal her secret talent to her mother, also her role model. At first, Holly Aleece Thomas, better known as Holly Wood, was skeptical of her daughter's rapping skills. However, when Megan performed in front of her, her mother became her biggest fan.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-rise-of-a-star>The Rise of a Star</h2><p>Since 2016, Megan has been managing her time masterfully to balance schooling and a music career because she refuses to compromise. The young star began by releasing music taps on Soundcloud and Youtube. She got her big break when they started going viral.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of her initial hits was 'The Houston Cypher.' Through this performance, she gained immense popularity because she was the only women rapper in this rooftop cypher performance. She was about 21 years old at that point and had already started shining bright in a group of 10 talented rappers. Her next release was Rich Ratchet in 2016, known for its robust and assertive tone coming from a Black Woman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kentucky AG Not Happy About Being Dissed By Megan Thee Stallion On SNL</a></span></p><p>Megan Thee Stallion established her place in the world of rapping with her 2016 performance. Everything that followed was a reassertion of her bold voice along with a new level of mastery. In 2017, Megan <a href=#>dropped a rework of XXXTentacion's</a> 'Look At Me!,' in the form of freestyling known as 'Stalli (Freestyle).' The following year she released another of her numbers called 'Freak Nasty,' which presented a bolder version of herself in the form of Tina Snow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan's 2019 hits include the jam called 'Big Ole Freak,' famous for its twerking competition staged at a gas station and Tina Snow's charming presence in 2019. Megan released another of her songs called 'Cash Shit,' also featuring DaBaby. She brings in her Hot Girl Meg personality alongside Tina Snow and her original self in this music performance.</p><p>Her collaboration with Cardi B to produce the hit song called 'WAP' has created hype ever since it got related in 2020. It has been successful in breaking multiple records. This song reaffirms Megan's empowering take on body positivity and dismissal of social taboos that make women feel inferior and restricted.</p><h2 id=megan-thee-stallion-s-latest-achievement>Megan Thee Stallion's Latest Achievement</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Thee Stallion's recent achievement has been the prestigious Grammy award that she won <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in March 2021</a>. She bagged the first trophy announced on the official telecast. She is also known to have won an award for her superhit rap song, Savage, which has been breaking the internet and especially Instagram reels, winning fans' hearts.</p><p>Savage has been nominated twice for being the <a href=#>best record and rap song</a> of the year. Megan won the best rap performance award for Savage.</p><p>Megan Thee Stallion has been making history by being the first winner of the best new artist after Lauren Hill, who won the same back in 1999. She stands after Chance the Rapper, who was the best solo rapper back in 2017.</p><p>Megan went through a rough childhood, and her peers bullied her. Although she also had supportive and understanding parents to help her grow into the strong woman she is today. <a href=#>Her mother</a>&nbsp;influences&nbsp;her music career, and her father is the emotional pillar. Thus, it comes as no surprise that she is the creator of great raps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Walmart: The Rise Of A Billion Dollar Company</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The List</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prPAp2StoJWaerTAwKWjoqeeqHq0wcKcnKyrXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-thee-stallion-s-musical-journey-to-success.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./quincy-remembers-his-mother-kim-porter-in-heartfelt-post.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./quincy-remembers-his-mother-kim-porter-in-heartfelt-post.html>Quincy Remembers His Mother Kim Porter In Heartfelt Post</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lea-seydoux-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth.html>Lea Seydoux Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lea-seydoux-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
