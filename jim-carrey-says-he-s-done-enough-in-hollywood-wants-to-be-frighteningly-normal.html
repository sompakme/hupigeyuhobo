While it may come as a surprise to some, the comedian has been entertaining the public for nearly three decades, so his retirement from the film industry isn't out of the question.The beloved actor seemed to want to sit back and enjoy the fruits of his achievement at this stage in his life. In a recent interview, he addressed the reason why he was planning to take a step away from acting and would probably retire. He has also spoken out on the things he’s ‘ignored’ in the name of his career.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Actor Called Jim Carrey’s Method Acting Selfish And Narcissistic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey-claim-is-ready-to-retire-from-acting>Jim Carrey Claim Is Ready To Retire From Acting</h2><p>Jim Carrey <a href=#>appears to be fed up with the spotlight</a>. "I've done enough," the prolific comedic revealed in an interview, adding that he is "pretty serious" about retiring from acting. He shared the news while promoting his next film, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, after being told that country legend Dolly Parton said she would like Jim to play her former music partner Porter Wagoner in a Parton biopic.</p><p>Caught by surprise, Jim reacted, “It’s a lovely thing. But I’m retiring.” When asked whether he was being serious, he doubled down by saying, “I’m being fairly serious, yeah.” However, he went on to say that his desire to walk away from his profession is not yet definite.</p><p>“It depends. If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road. But I’m taking a break.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, “I really like my quite life and I really like putting paint on canvas and I really love my spiritual life and I feel like – and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say as long as time exists – I have enough. I’ve done enough. I am enough.”</p><p>Although fans of the actor are used to him taking extended acting breaks, it appears he’s ready to throw in the towel. In just a few short years, he went from having largely disappeared from Hollywood to becoming the talk of the town once again, only to quickly decide to retire.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Disturbing History Of Jim Carrey’s Most Memorable ‘In Living Color’ Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey-wants-to-fulfill-things-he-rsquo-s-ignored>Jim Carrey Wants To Fulfill Things He’s Ignored</h2><p>At this point in his life, Jim Carrey made headlines for implying that he might retire from acting. Aside from saying that he has done enough as an actor, he has opened up about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things he has ignored in favor of his career</a>. And now, he’s ready to fulfill them and dedicate more time to living outside of Hollywood.</p><p>In another interview, Jim revealed that there are specific activities that he’s looking to get back to. He spilled, “I gotta get out of here before I slap someone. Honestly, I feel like there’s so many things, because I’ve been so busy for so long, important things that I’ve ignored. Like, there’s 25 years of Mystery Science Theater I have to catch up on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor added, “And there’s painting. I do paint. I’m gonna be putting out NFTs. I’ll announce that on Twitter soon. And that’s kinda fun for me still.” He clearly has a lot of things he wants to accomplish before it is too late. Surely, his fans can understand why he’s ready to spread his wings outside of acting.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Is Jim Carrey’s Highest Grossing Comedy?</a></span></p><p>Managing fame and a hectic work schedule for decades may be exhausting, especially at the level of celebrity that the comedy actor has attained.

Nothing going on. Whole lotta nothing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many stars reach the point at which they feel like they are done with fame. Jim, as comedic and eccentric as he can be, has proven one of the most successful actors in Hollywood, So if he says it is time to retire from acting, then that’s probably the case.</p><p>But before he finally bid his goodbye, Jim Carrey has been <a href=#>mired in a bit of controversy recently</a>, and that could be behind his decision to retire. Some people blame him for playing a role in creating anti-vaccine sentiment in America back when he was dating Jenny McCarthy.</p><p>He has also been criticized for his comments about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, which many feel was hypocritical considering that Jim Carrey <a href=#>once kissed a teenage Alicia Silverstone</a> at an awards show without her consent.</p><p>However, from Carrey's comments, his retirement has nothing to do with that drama.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Reason Why We Don’t Hear About Jim Carrey Anymore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsButsimZJyZoqeyunnRnquiqpmjtG6y0aikZpmTqbavs44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-carrey-says-he-s-done-enough-in-hollywood-wants-to-be-frighteningly-normal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./judge-faith-jenkins-marries-kenny-lattimore-in-romantic-ceremony.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./judge-faith-jenkins-marries-kenny-lattimore-in-romantic-ceremony.html>Judge Faith Jenkins Marries Kenny Lattimore in Romantic Ceremony</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./get-free-starbucks-today-in-honor-of-earth-day.html>Get Free Starbucks Today In Honor Of Earth Day!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./get-free-starbucks-today-in-honor-of-earth-day.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
