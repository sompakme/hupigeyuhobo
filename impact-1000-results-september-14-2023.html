He then welcomes out the most influential Knockout in history Gail Kim. She throws it to a video package on the greatest Knockouts moments.</p><p>Scott starts to speak again when The Beautiful People’s music hits. They make their classic entrance. Love questions Gail if that was the best clips they could’ve shown since they showed a bunch of ugly people outside of themselves. Velvet calls it security cam footage at Walmart. Gail sarcastically welcomes them back as they do what they do best — be rude and obnoxious. They start to circle Gail when Gisele Shaw’s music hits.</p><p>The Shaw-entourage walks down to the ring and apologizes for Gail being rude to them. Shaw says there would be no Quintessential&nbsp;﻿Diva without The Beautiful People. She’s honored to have taken their spot and improved on it. Love fires back, questioning what she just said. Shaw spells out the definition of “improved.” Sky questions who’s so great from their generation. Jordynne Grace walks out.</p><p>Grace says Shaw is actually from her generation. She names ODB, Tara, Traci, and Gail as some of the greats. But the other constant was the “annoying, vapid b****es.” Deonna Purrazzo comes out. Deonna says she’s here to represent her generation, not Jordynne or Gisele. A “Virtuosa” chant breaks out. The Age of Virutosa started when she beat Grace for the title. Out comes current champ Trinity to remind them who’s currently on top.</p><p>Deonna tells Trinity when she’s had three. Gail says she can find her when she’s had seven. Awesome Kong’s music hits and she has Raisha Saeed with her. Saeed says if anyone wants to fight, they’ll be crushed by Kong. Tasha Steelz returns! She says we can’t have the 1,000th episode and talk about history without her. She announces herself as the fifth member of Team Beautiful People, Shaw, Evans, and Purrazzo. No one else can be the greatest who beat the greatest. Then out comes Hardcore Country.</p><p>Mickie says by the looks of it, she doesn’t have to remind Tasha who she is or what she’s done. All she can really say is, “Hardcore country is back.” She makes it official that she’s joining of Team Trinity, Gail, Grace, and Kong. Mickie dubs themselves “Team Over.” She says next week will be the greatest fight in Knockouts history.</p><p>***</p><p>Backstage, EY is talking to America’s Most Wanted when Santino and Shark Boy interrupt.

They hit 3D (sans table) on Singh and Devon covers for the win.</p><p>They move the table over. Devon props Rohit up and Ray drives him through the table.</p><p>Josh talks about how special it is to walk down to the ring. He’s been an Impact fan for 20 years and he’s proud to say it. But now, he’s here to get back his gold.</p><p>Alex Shelley comes down. He runs down Josh chasing the next buck. Josh tells him to relax and thanks him for what he’s done for 21 years. He was happy to see Alex win the world title. Things stay heated as they hype each other up.
