The project turned out to be quite the success, so much that MTV picked it up in 2012 for a brand new reality series of the same name, having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nev step in as the show's host.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev hosted the series alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Joseph</a>, that is until his departure in 2018. Despite the big change, Schulman has always remained grounded, mainly due to his strong support system. The MTV star married wife, Laura Perlongo back in 2017, and share two beautiful children, with one on the way!</p><p>Although Schulman has lived quite the life in the public eye, Laura isn't too far off when it comes to her successful career in writing, sparking an interest in what exactly she does, and what her net worth might be!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Has Nev Schulman Made From Hosting “Catfished”?</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-nev-schulman-39-s-wife-laura-perlongo>Who Is Nev Schulman's Wife, Laura Perlongo?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev Schulman may be a victim of catfishing, however, it's clear the universe had nothing but good in store for Nev when it came to him meeting Laura Perlongo. If any of you are a fan of the hit MTV series, then you know Nev takes relationships very seriously, so when it came time for him to fall for Laura, he didn't play around!</p><p>The star is quite vocal about his adoration for Laura, so much that his Instagram feed is practically a throne to their romance, which fans cannot get enough of! Although we know the two are madly in love, fans aren't so certain who Laura is outside of her role as a wife and mother of soon-to-be three!</p><p>Nev and Laura tied the knot back on July 22, 2017, in East Hampton, New York, which took place following their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14-month engagement!</a> In 2016, a year prior to saying their "I do's", Laura and Nev welcomed their first child together, Cleo James Schulman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This past June, the couple celebrated their 6 year wedding anniversary! Nev shared a post of the two, acting goofy like always, with nothing but a loving message for Laura. While Nev knows how to write a caption, Laura Perlongo is actually the professional writer when it comes to the two.</p><p>In 2019, the duo welcomed their second child, Beau, making them a family of four, however, that is set to change very soon! Earlier this year, Nev and Laura announced they were officially expecting their third child together, however, the journey hasn't been too easy. Laura has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite an emotional pregnancy</a>, and while her due date is only a month away, she's quite ready to give birth! "It's daunting!" Perlongo described the pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Actually Happened To These Catfish Couples After The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-laura-perlongo-worth>How Much Is Laura Perlongo Worth?</h2><p>Prior to Laura becoming a mother and tying the knot with Nev Schulman, she worked as a freelance writer and photographer! It didn't take much time before she was branching out into the world of digital media, launching her very own Facebook series called We Need To Talk.</p><p>Laura and Nev both work on the series, where they use the platform to help "couples resolve relationship issues", the show description says. Perlongo has also gained some experience hosting alongside Nev on Catfish. While she isn't a series regular, Laura began co-hosting the show with Nev as of last season!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Laura, her work in the world of publishing and media has served her quite well, amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $500,000!</a> While neither Laura nor Nev live a life of luxury, the soon-to-be quintet knows how to have their fun, making it clear that family, really is everything with these two.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Is It Really Like Being On ‘Catfish’?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilnq5dqLCpwcummKdlp56zpnnJqJlmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-nev-schulman-s-wife-do-for-a-living-and-what-s-her-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-crazy-things-you-never-knew-about-margot-robbie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-crazy-things-you-never-knew-about-margot-robbie.html>10 Crazy Things You Never Knew About Margot Robbie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-corcoran-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Tom Corcoran Obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-corcoran-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
