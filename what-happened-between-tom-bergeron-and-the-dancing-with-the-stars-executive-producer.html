Bergeron himself was furious he had been replaced by Banks, but he held his head up high knowing that his lengthy run on the show brought along many memories and an overall positive experience.</p><p>But in March 2022, when it was revealed that a certain executive producer at DWTS had parted ways from the ABC show, it became evidently clear who may have been behind Bergeron’s firing. Here’s the lowdown...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-tom-bergeron-fired-from-39-dwts-39>Why Was Tom Bergeron Fired From 'DWTS'?</h2><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Bergeron shed light on why he believed he had been fired from DWTS, insisting that it was deeper than just sharing “creative differences” with producers.</p><p>Apparently, the TV fan-favorite was not particularly fond of the celebrities that were being cast for the show, presumably as many of the stars who’ve appeared on the show in recent years have either been D-list reality stars or social media influencers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine Chiu And Other Celebrities Who Got Injured On ‘Dancing With The Stars’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The father-of-two didn’t agree with the casting choices, particularly in 2019 when former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was brought onboard as a contestant. Bergeron argued that bringing political figures on DWTS was ultimately a bad look.</p><p>"Whether it was somebody I voted for or didn't, I didn't think a political person was an appropriate booking for the show, but also for the time we were going to be on, which was really on the cusp of the presidential election campaign, so we differed on that," he gushed.</p><p>"I was public about that. I don't think that sat well with the producer or the network.”</p><p>"The show that I left was not the show that I loved. So at the end of the seasons that turned out to be my last season, I kind of knew.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# style=display:inline!important>Are Jenna Johnson And Val Chmerkovskiy From ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Enjoying Married Life?</a></span></p><p>Bergeron insisted that he and Andrews were expecting the news of their firing after wrapping their final season together, adding that they “had more fun being fired than virtually anybody.”</p><p>At the time of the interview, Bergeron insisted that while he was no longer on DWTS, he still had a “great fondness” for the show and encouraged viewers to continue watching.</p><p>Following their exit, it was executive producer Andrew Llinares who spoke out about the change to Entertainment Tonight, saying, "I think it's all about evolution. I think any show like this that's been on for many, many seasons needs to continue to evolve.</p><p>“I think changing the host was all about evolution. It was about making the show feel fresh, making it feel new, kind of make it reach out to a new audience, as well as the audience that's been there for years.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Dancing With The Stars’: Jojo Siwa’s Perfect Score Performance Made Fans Cry</a></span></p><p>"When a show has been on for this many seasons, it's very easy to stay in a place where there's nothing wrong, but actually does the show feel fresh, exciting and new? It's tough.”</p><p>After the news of his firing was announced, Bergeron had taken to his social media to thank his fans for their support over the years as he was waving goodbye to a lengthy run on DWTS.</p><p>"It's been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career," he wrote. "I'm grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.”</p><p>"That said, now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andrew-llinares-leaves-dwts-and-bergeron-comments>Andrew Llinares Leaves DWTS And Bergeron Comments</h2><p>In March 2022, it was announced that Llinares would be leaving DWTS after five seasons, much to the delight of Bergeron, further implying that it was the executive producer who made the decision to fire the 66-year-old and Andrews.</p><p>Following Deadline’s report of Llinares’ departure, a fan shared a tweet about the news to Bergeron and asked for his “thoughts” on the matter.</p><p>“Karma’s a b****,” he replied along with a winking emoji.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# style=display:inline!important>The Real Reason Why Brian Austin Green Wanted To Join ‘Dancing With The Stars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmrJ%2BieqOx0aCcq6eeYq6vsIytn55llJa7pLXNoGSwoaSderW0xGaqrZmiqHqmxMScrK2hppp6sb7OnaycnaJk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-tom-bergeron-and-the-dancing-with-the-stars-executive-producer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-straight-actresses-who-played-gay-characters-very-convincingly.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-straight-actresses-who-played-gay-characters-very-convincingly.html>15 Straight Actresses Who Played Gay Characters Very Convincingly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-fear-did-eminem-confront-while-making-8-mile.html>What Fear Did Eminem Confront While Making '8 Mile'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-fear-did-eminem-confront-while-making-8-mile.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
