Sure it is easy when they are smiling, but just like with babies, it is sometimes frustrating when you can't figure out how to help them. After all, animals have good days and bad and just like people, they can get a little crabby when they're not feeling well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If we lived in Narnia, there would be no issues, but until they start talking directly to us, using a pet communicator is often the next best thing. Some psychics claim they can read both people and animals, while others&nbsp;specialize in and only have the extrasensory talent for hearing the thoughts and images that animals send out.</p><p>We believed Dr. Dolittle could do it, so why not others? Here is our list of ten of the top animal communicators in the country and although there are others, this group is heralded by their clients and the&nbsp;media. See what you think and if you have others we should know about, add them&nbsp;to the comments section. After all, we have to do our research the hard way because we're not psychic list-makers.</p><h2 id=10-lorrie-the-pet-psychic><strong>10. Lorrie the Pet Psychic</strong></h2><p>Via: lorriethepetpsychic.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lorrie has been featured on the Oprah Winfrey show, among other popular media shows. She is a third-generation medium and started communicating with animals at a very early age, although has only been doing it for a living for the past 19 or so years. Her most publicized experience was when she helped find Tinkerbell, a little Chihuahua who was carried away during a storm.</p><p>Lorrie is capable of performing readings over the phone, house calls or video chat and prices vary depending on session length ($52 - 15 minutes, $104 - 30 minutes, $208 - 60 minutes). She works with all types of pets and uses her sixth sense with people too.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-pet-psychic-marla-steele><b>9. Pet Psychic Marla Steele</b></h2><p>Via: vividlife.me</p><p>Marla grew up in a family that reinforced&nbsp;skills, such&nbsp;as being guided by her dreams, listening to her inner voice and gut feelings. As she grew older, she was aware of relatives who had passed. Her very ill grandmother sent her&nbsp;favorite Arabian horse to Marla which&nbsp;arrived within minutes of her grandmother's passing. The Arabian, Steele, and Marla became instantly bonded and began communicating whether they were in the same proximity or not. She felt it was a sign from her grandmother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marla has been a professional animal communicator for close to 15 years and is a celebrity in her own right. She has been on numerous radio and television talk shows and continues to offer private readings, classes and other services. Her prices include $75 for 15-minutes and one-hour sessions for $150.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-val-heart-mba-pacbp><strong>8. Val Heart, MBA, PaCBP</strong></h2><p>Via: plus.google.com</p><p>Val Heart is in-tune with animals and believes they offer a large contribution to our world. In her words, "Animals know us better than almost any other being on the planet. They see what's in our mind's eye, they feel what we're feeling, and they can get closer to our hearts than anyone else because they get under our defense mechanisms."</p><p>Val specializes in the human animal body-mind connection and helps animal owners understand changes in their pet's behaviors, maladies and attitudes. Reviews of her work are consistently excellent. Prices for her services are not posted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-ursula-rabe-animal-communicator><strong>7.

Asia Voight&nbsp;-&nbsp;Animal Communicator</strong></h2><p>Via: www.oneresourceforauthors.com</p><p>Asia Voight, like many of the others, has been communicating with animals since early on. In fact, she was a natural and began talking with a neighborhood Golden Retriever. Asia reminds us that animals speak more of our language than we do of theirs and it is her intent to bring people and their animals closer together.</p><p>She can help communicate with pets who have passed over, in addition to behavioral issues and encourages owners to "increase their intuition, save on veterinary bills, lengthen the life of your animal companions and create health and well-being for your entire family". Her fees range from $160 to $350, depending on how many animals are being scheduled within the session.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-heidi-wright---animal-psychic><strong>4.

Lydia's fees are similar to many others with $40 for a 15-minute consultation, during which time she will ask questions and do a body scan on the animal to see if there is any valuable health information.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-sonia-fitzpatrick><strong>1.
