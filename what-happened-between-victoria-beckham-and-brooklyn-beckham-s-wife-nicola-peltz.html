Since they married, Peltz' Instagram has featured worrying posts of her crying and talking about her insecurities. It appears the feud started around the time of the wedding where Victoria was kept out of plans. Although the couple addressed the feud in a recent Variety interview, claiming "everyone gets along," it looks like the story isn't going anywhere.</p><p>So, is there any truth behind these rumors of a feud between Bates Motel actress Nicola Peltz and her singer and fashion designer mother-in-law Victoria Beckham?</p><h2 id=what-are-the-issues-between-nicola-peltz-and-victoria-beckham><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Are The Issues Between Nicola Peltz And Victoria Beckham?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The drama between Nicola Peltz's and her famous mother-in-law<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> first unfolded online when a source told Page Six </a>in early August that Nicola and Victoria Beckham were not on good terms.</p><p>“They can’t stand each other and don’t talk,” the source revealed. “The build-up to the wedding was horrendous.” It looks like Nicola and Victoria fell out over wedding plans.</p><p>“She wouldn’t clue Victoria in on anything. Communication was minimal.” The source added that the feud has affected Brooklyn's relationship with his own family “They haven’t spoken to him much in the last few months,” the insider said.</p><h2 id=why-nicola-peltz-didn-39-t-wear-a-victoria-beckham-wedding-dress><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Nicola Peltz Didn't Wear A Victoria Beckham Wedding Dress</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is rumored that the feud started when Nicola Peltz, 27-year-old, wouldn't wear the wedding dress Victoria designed. She instead wore a white Valentino dress.</p><p>“I was going to, and I really wanted to, and then a few months down the line, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she realized that her atelier couldn’t do it,</a> so then I had to pick another dress,” she revealed. “She didn’t say you can’t wear it; I didn’t say I didn’t want to wear it."</p><p>A source told the Daily Mail that Victoria "couldn't help" but get involved with the planning and that she was "constantly overriding" their decisions.</p><p>Victoria "may have overstepped the line" with her input, the source explained, with the newspaper adding that the mother of the groom felt "humiliated" by the way things turned out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=were-there-issues-between-nicola-peltz-and-brooklyn-beckham-39-s-families><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Were There Issues Between Nicola Peltz And Brooklyn Beckham's Families?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The source told Page Six recently </a>that there is a huge issue between the Beckham and the Peltz families.</p><p>“Victoria and Nicola are just collateral damage. It’s not just about two women — it’s two families coming together,” the source said. “It’s pretty obvious there’s an issue between the two families. Everybody needs to find their place. They’re just not quite connecting yet.”</p><p>The source also revealed that the problem between the families appears to be about branding. Brooklyn’s famous British parents want their son and their daughter-in-law to follow in their footsteps of leading clothing lines, perfume, and other ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There is a very deliberate move orchestrated by Nicola and her mom and funded by Nelson. There is a reason why Brooklyn and Nicola are now ‘Peltz Beckham.’ It’s all about branding,” the source says about Nicola’s billionaire father Nelson, a non-executive chairman of Madison Square Garden among other lucrative things. “I think that Nicola and her mom come up with ideas, Nelson can fund anything, and he says yes! But for David and Victoria, it has to have some substance.”</p><h2 id=do-the-peltz-and-beckhams-have-different-values><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Do The Peltz And Beckhams Have Different Values?</span></h2><p>Another source to Page Six that the Beckhams and the Peltz' have very different values.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The Beckhams are quite old-fashioned. They believe that everyone should make their own way up in the world,” said the source. “Although they’ll always give their kids a leg up in terms of support and endorsement, they famously made Brooklyn work in a cafe to teach him about work ethic and to get some values. They were really keen to support his passion for photography, so they helped him get internships; then he got into cooking, and they’ve supported that.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Brooklyn Beckham's Cooking Show Costs $100,000 Per 8-Minute Episode">Brooklyn Beckham's Cooking Show Costs $100,000 Per 8-Minute Episode</a></span></p><p>This drama hasn't affected Brooklyn's relationship with his father-in-law. “Brooklyn has become so, so close to the Peltz family, and to Nicola’s dad, especially.

Many felt the lack of attention put on Victoria during the wedding may have been due to envy.</p><p>A source told The Daily Mail in July this year that guests at their wedding found it unusual that David and Victoria weren’t seated at the top table with Brooklyn and Nicola, as this is a British custom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Are David Beckham's Most Interesting Tattoos (And Their Meaning)">These Are David Beckham's Most Interesting Tattoos (And Their Meaning)</a></span></p><p>“The top table was all Peltzes, and it really felt as if the Beckhams were not at the forefront.

That’s where it started, and then they ran with that.” Brooklyn added on, “I’ve learned they’re always going to try to write stuff like that. They’re always going to try and put people down. But everyone gets along, which is good.”</p><p>It is believed that the interview hasn't gone down well with the Beckhams, with it said to go against their philosophy when it comes to unfavorable stories written about them.</p><p>A source told Heat, "The interview left David and Victoria open-mouthed.
