And then there is the kind of <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> that <strong><a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> </strong>puts out into the world. Her songs have good beats, but they also describe a range of emotions that prove that she is wise beyond her years. The singer is only 21 years old and has already made a massive impact on the industry. Fans love that she bares her soul in her songs and that she writes with her older brother, Finneas O'Connell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish has had a few relationships, including one with the much older Jesse Rutherford. The two are no longer together. But when they were still dating, Eilish talked about how well they got along and how happy she was.

As he told Billboard, “We made the whole thing in the bedroom. People are often like, ‘When you think about when you first started making music to like now, from a bedroom to a studio…’ — and we’re like, ‘No. We’re still in the same bedroom.'”</p><p>Eilish also told Billboard, “This album is all me. Nobody’s name. It’s kind of like a coming-of-age album. I’m 17. I did mostly everything for the first time last year. So it’s weird. Like, you know, I learned how to drive last year.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Billie Eilish Really Spends Her Incredible Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2021, the singer put out her second album, "Happier Than Ever."

She said about Finneas O'Connell, "We see each other all the time, and also now, we’re starting to make music again.
