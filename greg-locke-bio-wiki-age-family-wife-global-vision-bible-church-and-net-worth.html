They are still together as of August 2020. His divorce from his first wife was one of his most controversial moments as he was cheating on her with Taisha (<strong>Tai Cowan McGee</strong>) and also said in an interview that his first wife was mentally ill.</p><p>She was outraged at his comments but has not directly said that she wanted anything about the marriage. Before this, he was married to&nbsp;<strong>Melissa. </strong>His relationship with Melissa was always rocky but it boiled over towards the end when she was “exchanged” for his church assistant.</p><p>Melissa and the pastor were married for more than 21 years and they have <strong>3 boys and a daughter together</strong>.&nbsp;Both of his wives have been part of his evangelism and his church. In fact, his first wife is an outspoken supporter of the Christian faith and regularly posts a lot of faithful messages supporting their own church.</p><p>Even his second wife is a passionate supporter of their religious beliefs and has a huge following online about their purpose and God’s message.&nbsp;Some of the other pastors that have been active have called Locke an “Adulterer in God’s Eyes”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=greg-locke-salary></span><span>Greg Locke Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details pertaining to his annual earnings are currently unavailable.
