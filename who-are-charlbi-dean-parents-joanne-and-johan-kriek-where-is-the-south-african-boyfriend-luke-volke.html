Following her untimely demise, her parents are mourning their huge loss.</p><p>Since Charli always maintained secrecy about her personal life, there is rarely some information accessible about her family. Besides her parents’ names, nothing much is known about their professions to date.</p><p>At the age of six, she began her modeling career and appeared in many catalogs and commercials. When she turned 12, she was signed by Alfa Model Management.</p><p>When she landed her big break modeling for Italian Vogue, her father decided it would be best for her to begin home education rather than formal schooling.</p><p>She and her fellow model, Ashton Schnehage, survived a car accident in 2008. At the time, she received life-saving surgery at Milnerton Medi-Clinic.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-charlbi-dean-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volker></span>Where Is Charlbi Dean South African Boyfriend Luke Volker?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlbi Dean was dating South African model Luke Volker.

She was a superb actress who had extraordinary acting abilities.</p><p>Film critic&nbsp;Guy Lodge&nbsp;in pain, tweeted, “What a massive shock and tragedy. She’s so witty and deadpan and clockwork-precise in Triangle of Sadness, and I was so excited to see a new South African talent on the international scene.”</p><p>THEE ACADEMY Playwright Jeremy O Harris&nbsp;wrote, “This is absolutely devastating. She was such an exciting performer to me after seeing her in Triangle of Sadness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmmqGZoqGvqnnDnpinZaCWv6a606xko6eRo7umecCnm2ain52ur3nKq6Ceo12staa%2BxGagrGWknbJuv86uq6FlkZu%2Fqq%2FAp2Sbp6mbv6qxzZ1kpa2bmnq3u8uknKs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-charlbi-dean-parents-joanne-and-johan-kriek-where-is-the-south-african-boyfriend-luke-volke.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-the-richest-woman-robert-pattinson-dated-and-is-she-richer-than-he-is.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-the-richest-woman-robert-pattinson-dated-and-is-she-richer-than-he-is.html>Who Is The Richest Woman Robert Pattinson Dated, And Is She Richer Than He Is?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-9-famous-deceased-musicians-left-their-fortunes-to.html>Who 9 Famous Deceased Musicians Left Their Fortunes To</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-9-famous-deceased-musicians-left-their-fortunes-to.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
