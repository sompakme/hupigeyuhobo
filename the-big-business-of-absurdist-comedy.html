Surrealist <a href=#>paintings</a> by masters like&nbsp;<a href=#>Dali</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Man Ray</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Magritte</a> altered the artistic landscape, leading the way for modern masters like <a href=#>Banksy</a>, <a href=#>Damien Hirst</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Koons</a>. When <a href=#>Bob Dylan</a> picked up the electric guitar at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newport Folk Festival</a> back in 1965, he gave way for electric folk that now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wins Grammys</a> and blasts through Spotify playlists from bands like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mumford and Sons</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">War on Drugs</a>. And Andy Kaufman&nbsp;debuting on the first season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday Night Live back in 1975</a>&nbsp;created a new genre of absurdist comedy that continues to shape the comedic culture of today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Richest Comedian In The World: An Inside Look At Jerry Seinfeld's $950 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaufman’s decision to expand the definition of what it means to be a comedian and what constitutes as funny is a movement that echoes through some of the most popular comedians of the last decade. Whether it’s Eric Andre or Tom Green, absurdist comedy has moved beyond the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">smashing of a watermelon</a> and the shock value of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Dice Clay</a> and has found its place in a world where <a href=#>David Lynch</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Lynch</a> share handshakes, last names, and visionary goals. It has not only changed the sense of humor of what our culture finds funny, but has crossed the fourth wall into the extremely meta territory of the audience becoming the joke, the comedian becoming the punchline, and the rest of the world laughing because they can’t believe what it is they’re seeing.</p><h2 id=absurd-origins>Absurd Origins</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The origins of absurdist comedy are debated among the dedicated members of the community. But one comedian who emerged within the 1970’s seems to gather a consensus among comedians as one of the founding fathers of the movement. Often called the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-comedian</a> which justifies himself as an absurdist, Andy Kaufman broke ground by having bits and routines that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">resembled performance art</a> more than stand up comedy. He blurred the line between what was a character and what was actually himself in a seamless design that allowed the audience to be perpetually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confused over his existence, even in his death</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitch Hedberg</a> is a comedian who took the torch from Kaufman and lit several candles along the way, inspiring the next generation of innovative artists to pursue the medium. His simplistic style of wandering one-liners with absurdist imagery and no cohesive connection established himself as an early genre-breaker and innovative icon. His work had a profound effect on other artists who started to blur the line of what was comedy and what was reality including modern masters like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artie Lange</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Atell</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=masters-of-the-medium>Masters of the Medium</h2><p>While stand-up continued to be a bastion of the art form, it wasn’t until the genre-defying comedians started having their own television shows that the&nbsp;style became a mainstream medium that the public started to identify with. One of the first TV stars known for his absurdist show was Tom Greene. Hosted on MTV, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tom Green Show</a>&nbsp;featured&nbsp;bizarre segments, songs and sketches that made the audience question what was happening. Called both innovate and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the worst television show of all time</a>, the cult-like success of the series eventually led to absurdist icons&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href=#>Sacha Baron Cohen</a> and <a href=#>Zach Galifianakis</a>&nbsp;having&nbsp;their&nbsp;own shows which followed form.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This same instinct came into play on another MTV television series, <a href=#>Jackass</a>. Now slated to make its<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fourth feature film debut</a> in October of 2021, the Jackass crew utilized the absurdist imagery of the top comedians and created sketches and skits that incorporated the idea of shock value into the act, scaring people but making them laugh within the process. These iconic television shows and their innovative styles all culminated in 2012 with the debut of Adult Swims new Late Night program <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Eric Andre Show</a>.</p><h2 id=the-underground-becomes-the-mainstream>The Underground Becomes the Mainstream</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Eric Andre show defined its original intent as ‘becoming the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worst talk show host on television</a>.’ With the bar so low, but simultaneously so high, it became a scientific balancing act to create humorous content, maintain absurdist imagery, and create an innovative style, all while still trying to make people laugh. But the Eric Andre Show accomplished the herculean task.</p><p>Featuring unlikely celebrity guests like&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Osbourne</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Amber Rose</a>, it quickly became clear that certain celebrities were not quite aware of what the show was. Thinking they would be guests lobbed soft-ball questions in a studio, they quickly became the subject of pranks and jokes. Other guests were able to navigate the program with ease, blending seamlessly into the style and tone of the show like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Black</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler, the Creator</a>.</p><p>Andre also chose to re-invent with each new season. Ranging from gaining weight to shaving himself completely from head to toe, Andre chose to reinvent his persona throughout each season of his show. He also paid consistent homage to other absurdist artists that inspired the program. The fourth season was inspired by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Lynch’s Eraserhead</a> had been a television program, and during the shows fifth season, Andre <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dressed up</a> as surrealist icon and filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky’s character from the feature film The Holy Mountain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre even merged his Jackass predecessors on his own prank-based feature film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Trip</a> which was made under the guidance of Jackass producer Jeff Tremaine. The show had Andre’s style of comedy blended the shock value of GG Adams with the humorous sides of Kaufman, Hedberg, and Green. The culmination of style and commitment made Eric Andre not only a superstar in his own right, but also the forerunner of brining absurdist comedy into the mainstream.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#>Rolling With Dice: When Andrew Silverstein Changed Comedy</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheekyMonkeyComedy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RayNotBradbury</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VanityFair</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RollingStone</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGuardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artsy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVInsider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fader</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLmMoKmenZ5isrO1wmaYp5yimnqirtKuqZ2ho6l6pLvMnpuyZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-big-business-of-absurdist-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./watch-lil-uzi-vert-s-animated-video-for-xo-tour-llif3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./watch-lil-uzi-vert-s-animated-video-for-xo-tour-llif3.html>Watch Lil Uzi Verts Animated Video For XO TOUR LLIF3</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-allegedly-rejected-meghan-markle-as-experts-claim-she-chose-william-and-kate-s-side.html>Taylor Swift Allegedly Rejected Meghan Markle As Experts Claim She Chose William And Kate's Side</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swift-allegedly-rejected-meghan-markle-as-experts-claim-she-chose-william-and-kate-s-side.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
