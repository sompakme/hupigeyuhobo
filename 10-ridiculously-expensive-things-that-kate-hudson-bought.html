Hudson has a very high net worth of $80 million in addition to the money from her wealthy family. We're taking a look at some of her most expensive purchases.</p><h2 id=pacific-palisades-mansion>Pacific Palisades Mansion</h2><p>Kate Hudson purchased a mansion in the Pacific Palisades that has a special connection to her and her family. It was actually the house she grew up in. It was formerly owned by her mother Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.</p><p>Kate bought it back for a cool $5.5 million and it has undergone extensive renovations. The mansion has 7 bedrooms and is where Kate has chosen to settle down with her husband Matt Bellamy and son Ryder.</p><h2 id=the-house-next-door>The house next door</h2><p>It wasn't enough for Kate Hudson to simply buy back her childhood home in the Palisades. She and her husband began doing some extensive house hunting in Malibu and beyond only to realize the house they wanted all along was right next door to their current residence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Crazy Expensive Things Ellen DeGeneres Has Bought" href=#>10 Crazy Expensive Things Ellen DeGeneres Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Kate and Matt wound up buying the house right next door to their own and they bought it for $5.3 million. Now she has two mansions next door to each other. Does anyone need that much space? Rumor is that Kate plans to use the second house as a "guest mansion." If you're ever invited to Hudson's home you might get an entire mansion to yourself for a night!</p><h2 id=london-house>London house</h2><p>Kate Hudson is apparently quite the real estate guru. Not only does she have two homes back in California but she and her husband spent $4 million on a place in the UK. Hudson has always wanted to "put down roots" in London and so they purchased a home there.</p><p>They have plans to spend 6 months of the year there. It has a nursery, game room, and enough bedrooms for mother Goldie and step-father Kurt Russell to come to visit and stay. Apparently, Kate's parents visit her often, even all the way in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-choos>Jimmy Choos</h2><p>Hudson has stated before that she doesn't usually buy designer clothes because she can't afford them. Instead, she borrows from designers. It's hard to believe that given how many millions she spends regularly on houses.</p><p>But perhaps the reason she doesn't often buy designer clothing is that she would rather spend her money on designer shoes. Hudson loves a good pair of Jimmy Choos. She has heels, boots, casual wear, you name it. Jimmy Choos don't come cheap either. A pair of Jimmy Choo boots might cost you almost $1,000 and the formal wear is generally well over that price tag.</p><h2 id=jewelry>Jewelry</h2><p>Hudson is also known for her eclectic taste in jewelry.&nbsp;She enjoys wearing "boho chic" styles of fashion and she even has her own jewelry line called Chrome Hearts. Even though it is advertised as being bohemian it is quite blinged out with diamonds and other valuable gemstones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Hudson spends a large amount of money on her jewelry. She also has several brand endorsements with companies like Fabletics which helps keep her furnished in the finest of wares and jewels.</p><h2 id=cadillac-escalade-esv>Cadillac Escalade ESV</h2><p>Some celebrities prefer having someone drive them around town while others would rather drive themselves. Hudson has at least two cars. She has a more modest Toyota Prius which costs about $25,000 and then she has a much fancier car in the Cadillac Escalade ESV.</p><p>She could often be seen driving around town in the Cadillac which generally costs more than $78,000. It's not clear exactly how much she spent on it but given how much money she has it was probably on the higher end of the scale. It's likely she bought it brand-new as well to ensure she can always travel around in style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stella-mccartney-gowns>Stella McCartney Gowns</h2><p>Despite claiming she doesn't usually buy designer clothes, there are some exceptions to that rule. Hudson has previously purchased gowns from designer Stella McCartney.</p><p>Depending on what kind of dress you're buying from the McCartney line, one garment can go for several thousand dollars. It's rumored that Hudson has several gowns from McCartney in her closet.</p><h2 id=guitars>Guitars</h2><p>Kate Hudson comes from a musical family so it's no big surprise that she would want to buy her son a guitar of his own. She bought him his first six-string guitar and has purchased one for herself too. Guitars are pricey.</p><p>Depending on what kind of guitar you're buying or what brand, they may cost you $1,000 or more although considering this is her son's first, Hudson may have bought one for a lower price but still likely spent several hundred dollars on it, if not more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pole-in-house>Pole in house</h2><p>As a way to help her get back into shape after having a baby, Hudson had a stripper pole installed in the bathroom into her house. Even her mother, Goldie Hawn, has talked about using it to do pole-dancing exercise routines. Considering how athletic Hudson is, this isn't that surprising.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Brad Pitt Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Brad Pitt Bought</a></span></p><p>It's no wonder she's able to keep her abs so toned all the time if she's doing pole routines on the regular. Pole dancing routines and workouts are some of the most difficult but they help tone your body in ways traditional exercise such as jogging, simply can't. But it does take quite a bit of upper-body strength to do it safely.</p><h2 id=birkenstocks>Birkenstocks</h2><p>Hudson has recently gotten into Birkenstock sandals. She's discussed learning to love them. Given they are a brand name, these sandals are comfortable but can be pricey. Some of them are even more than $1,000 depending on if you're getting a designer version.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right, some of the big designers like Prada have their own line of Birkenstocks. Most likely, Hudson is buying the less pricey ones since she's just getting acclimated to the style of a sandal but who knows what the future may hold for her?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Highest-Grossing Kate Hudson Movies Of All Time" href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Kate Hudson Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4osDEZp%2BunKOku26x16mcp6uZq7JuwMeipaCrXZe8trPHrWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-ridiculously-expensive-things-that-kate-hudson-bought.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-shows-full-of-pointless-steamy-hook-ups-you-ll-love.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-shows-full-of-pointless-steamy-hook-ups-you-ll-love.html>15 Shows Full Of Pointless Steamy Hook-Ups You'll Love</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nikki-bella-says-i-do-revelations-about-nikki-artem-s-wedding.html>'Nikki Bella Says I Do': Revelations About Nikki, Artem's Wedding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nikki-bella-says-i-do-revelations-about-nikki-artem-s-wedding.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
