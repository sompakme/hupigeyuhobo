While the world of reality shows has exploded in the past few decades to provide more people their fifteen minutes of fame, the '80s and '90s made it harder for an upcoming star to make an impact. Before the days of American Idol and America’s Got Talent, Star Search was a show that offered a chance for comedians, singers, and dancers to showcase their skills. These A-list celebs got their start vying for a prize on the popular talent show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-gave-girl-groups-a-shot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Beyoncé Gave Girl Groups A Shot</span></h2><p>While her start in Destiny’s Child really brought her name to the spotlight, Beyoncé actually started alongside Kelly Rowland in a band called Girl’s Tyme. The group auditioned in 1993 and made their way on the show only to ultimately lose the competition. They didn’t let that stop them as they went through some new members before finally settling on their trio that formed <a href=#>Destiny’s Child</a> and overtook the radios, charts, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even snatched a few Grammys</a>.</p><h2 id=usher-started-young><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Usher Started Young</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Usher is an example of Star Search getting it right, as he was crowned as the best teen vocalist when he<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> appeared on the show</a> in 1991. His performances caught the eye of renowned A&R representative and record label executive L.A. Reid, leading to a record deal. Usher has since been a huge success, earning eight Grammy Awards and twenty-two nominations.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Usher and Justin Bieber's Relationship Like Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=brad-garrett-gave-it-his-best><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brad Garrett Gave It His Best</span></h2><p>Best known for his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> role in Everybody Loves Raymond</a>, the gentle giant Brad Garrett first appeared to the public on Star Search in 1984 under the Comedy category. A new addition to the show, the comedy section allowed Garrett the stage he needed to become noticed by Johnny Carson and Ray Romano. Of course, it helps that he ended up being the first winner in the Comedy category, earning him a nice nest egg to work with before his big break.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake-came-in-with-country><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Timberlake Came In With Country</span></h2><p>Many believe that Justin Timberlake broke into the business with the assistance of 'N SYNC, however, the star brought his name to the screen before puberty even hit. At only 11 years old, Timberlake set out on Star Search with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">country song under the name of Justin Randall</a>. While he didn’t see a lot of success on the show, Timberlake believes that this appearance led to him booking The Mickey Mouse Club which then brought him into a number one boy band.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Timberlake Has Joined TikTok And Fans Think It's A Sign Of A New Album</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-archuleta-took-the-title><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>David Archuleta Took The Title</span></h2><p>Many claim David Archuleta’s fame stemmed solely from coming in<a href=#> second on American Idol</a>, but the young star actually showed up on screen five years prior on Star Search. Joining the Junior Vocalist category in the only season of the reboot, the singer actually took the top spot, winning his category and claiming victory before moving on to his next singing show appearance. Since then, the pop star has appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and released eight studio albums.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-became-a-sensational-singer><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Britney Spears Became A Sensational Singer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her incredible career and popularity, Britney Spears didn’t have immediate success. The star appeared on Star Search in the Junior Vocalist category in 1992, but inevitably lost out to Marty Thomas. Though she didn’t take the title, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singer still found success</a>. Her career became a hit overnight and her place in pop culture was solidified. Her fame skyrocketed even more so with her freedom from conservatorship in 2022, allowing the star to fully be herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears' Memoir Is Rumored To Be Delayed For A Very Strange Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=leann-rimes-came-on-screen-as-a-kid><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>LeAnn Rimes Came On Screen As A Kid</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Popular in the <a href=#>world of country singers</a>, LeAnn Rimes wasn’t an immediate success. The singer started off on Star Search at just eight years old. Rimes took the title of one-week champion, but her 1991 entrance didn’t see success beyond that. Still, just a small taste of performing was enough to convince the young singer that she wanted a career in country and, by 1996,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she had her first number one hit</a>.</p><h2 id=billy-porter-sang-sweet-notes><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Billy Porter Sang Sweet Notes</span></h2><p>Popular and poised from <a href=#>his role in Pose</a>, Billy Porter has made waves for his class, style, and skill. Before taking to Broadway for Kinky Boots and A Strange Loop, Porter was serenading the world on Star Search. Entering in 1992, the vocalist took the title, winning the $100,000 prize. Porter claimed that taxes took a good chunk, but he still managed to get his teeth fixed which he’s been incredibly thankful for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJ%2BhoqjBbq3PqZyaqpWZerC6jKyrmqpdqLKivsKhZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-celebs-who-first-appeared-on-star-search.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bob-harper-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bob-harper-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html>Bob Harper Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tim-daly-net-worth-therichest.html>Tim Daly Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tim-daly-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
