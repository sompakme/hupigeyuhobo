Sophie Turner shared a photo on Instagram of herself, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra, and Kevin Jonas and Danielle Jonas along with their two daughters Valentina and Alena.

She said, "To see the hard work and love and light you boys bring to your music… it’s an honor just to watch from the sidelines. After almost 20 years of hard work you boys are so deserving of this. I’m so lucky to count you as family.

People reported that Sophie also shared a picture of Priyanka wearing a tiara on her own social media account.</p><p>Danielle Jonas didn't post any photos with Sophie Turner on her Instagram in 2023 or 2022.

While sometimes sharing the raw and hard parts of life feels appropriate, most people would agree that they don't always want to talk about that stuff online. Celebrities must feel even more pressure to make it seem as if their lives are perfect.</p><p>Sophie Turner has always seemed to love her two sisters-in-law, and she has never said negative things about them. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Jonas was honest about Sophie Turner and Priyanka Chopra</a> and explained that she sometimes has a hard time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kevin-jonas-danielle-jonas.jpg><p>According to People, Danielle shared some vulnerable thoughts on the LadyGang podcast. She explained, “I am so different than him. It’s actually made it work even more because we’re not trying to fight for the fight celebrity part of it or whatever, but it is a love-hate. I feel like I am torn.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Didn't Danielle Jonas Roast Kevin At The 'Jonas Brothers Family Roast'?</a></span></p><p>Danielle continued in her podcast interview, “The two boys married somebody who, they’re actresses, they’re out there, everyone knows them.

We can relate on so many different levels. It's like, thank God, because you never know [about your in-laws]."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does Sophie Turner Regret About Doing 'Game Of Thrones'?</a></span></p><p>It sounds like Sophie genuinely loves Priyanka and Danielle.
