The moment she was cast to play the role of Rachel Green, everyone suddenly knew who Aniston was. More importantly, her performance earned her five Emmy nominations and one Emmy win. Meanwhile, the success of the show also meant that Aniston and her co-stars got paid more and more each season. Towards the end of the show’s run, the Friends cast even received a hefty $1 million per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Paul Rudd Almost Ran Jennifer Aniston Over</a></span></p><p>Aside from being paid lots of money for Friends, Aniston also managed to secure a lot of endorsement deals. These involved brands such as Glaceau Smartwater, Aveeno, and Emirates. It is believed that endorsements alone result in a $10 million payout for Aniston annually, according to Fox Business.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: How Much Did Jennifer Aniston Get Paid For The Show?</a></span></p><p>Since Friends, Aniston has also ventured out into films. Over the years, she’s starred in movies such as Along Came Polly, Rumor Has It…, Marley & Me, Horrible Bosses, Wanderlust, Cake, Mother’s Day, Dumplin’, and many others. In addition, Aniston also starred opposite good friend Adam Sandler in Netflix’s Murder Mystery. At the same time, Aniston decided to make a return to television in 2019 with the Apple TV+ series The Morning Show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, Aniston is estimated to be worth $200 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-started-in-commercials-then-became-a-movie-star>Brad Pitt Started In Commercials Then Became A Movie Star</h2><p>He started out as a guy in a Pringles commercial. Since then, Pitt has gone on to star in several hit movies. In the 90s, he starred in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, Legends of the Fall, Se7en, 12 Monkeys, The Devil’s Own, Seven Years in Tibet, and Fight Club.</p><p>He also followed this up with films like Ocean’s Eleven, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Troy, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Babel, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Inglorious Basterds, Moneyball, World War Z, Fury and 12 Years a Slave. More recently, Pitt also starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the critical hit Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood. Interestingly, Pitt has been known to take a pay cut from time to time. However, he often negotiates to get backend points in exchange.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Aniston, Pitt has also been known to have several lucrative endorsement deals. For instance, Pitt became the first male actor to take part in a campaign for Chanel No. 5 fragrance. According to a report from GoBankingRates.com that was published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, this resulted in a $7 million payout.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Brad Pitt Is Always Eating In His Movies</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Pitt is also one of the few actors who are actively working behind the scenes thanks to his own production company, Plan B Entertainment. Pitt co-founded the production company with Aniston, but he became the company’s sole owner following the couple’s divorce. In case you didn’t know, Plan B has been involved in the production of films such as The Departed, Moonlight, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Eat, Pray, Love. And because of his producer credits, you can be sure that Pitt is getting a share of the films’ box office earnings.

In the case of Aniston, you can expect to see her star in the second season of The Morning Show alongside fellow A-lister Reese Witherspoon.
