That timeline outlined several potentially scandalous things that went on during their divorce. One example of that is the fact that Baumgartner implied Costner may be a cheater in court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a legal filing, Baumgartner's legal team asked Costner to provide any documentation he had of any extramarital affairs he'd engaged in.

After all, Costner still spoke about loving Baumgartner when he talked to Access Hollywood during their child support battle. "It feels so bad. We're talking about somebody I love on the other side."</p><p>However, Radar Online's aforementioned report, which cited the National Enquirer, suggested Baumgartner may have had ulterior motives.

At that time, TMZ published photos of the rumored couple at a tennis fundraiser for Jewel’s Inspiring Children Foundation.</p><p>The reason the photos went viral was that Costner could be seen with his hands around Jewel's waist from behind in one of them. The photos certainly implied a great deal of intimacy between the two stars.</p><p>After TMZ's report, US Weekly spoke to an insider who claimed that Costner and Jewel had been quietly dating for months by that time. The insider also spoke about how much the pair respected each other. “Kevin and Jewel had an extremely high opinion of each other and have always gotten along great. They check a lot of boxes for each other.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qku9KtpZ6qo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5x6KqraeirnqmxMSsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-exes-after-his-rocky-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./keith-britton-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./keith-britton-net-worth-therichest.html>Keith Britton Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ease-neck-and-shoulder-pain.html>Ease Neck and Shoulder Pain</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ease-neck-and-shoulder-pain.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
