Back then, Vine videos were pure comedy, because they required you to be as creative as possible under the time limit. The video-sharing platform propelled some of its biggest stars' careers, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Paul brothers</a>, King Bach, Lele Pons, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Voice’ Winners Of The 2010s: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, only two years after hitting 200 million users, Vine was shut down. Since then, many of its stars have migrated to other social media, whether it's YouTube, Instagram, or even the now-growing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>. Here's a little throwback to ten Vine stars and what they've been up to now.</p><h2 id=king-bach><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>King Bach</span></h2><p>Andrew Bachelor, also known as King Bach, rose to stardom for amassing 11.3 million followers on Vine before its defunct. He was the most followed user on the platform. Since then, he'd ventured into acting and made his debut in Black Jesus from 2014 until 2015. Now, he runs a YouTube channel and often posts his day-to-day activities and comedies on TikTok for his 20 million followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zach-king><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Zach King</span></h2><p>While most took comedy's route for their stardom on Vine, Zach King went the extra mile and shot magic. Before its defunct, he joined Vine in September 2013 and quickly rose to millions of followers. Now, like many other former Vine stars, he joined TikTok to spread his magic to over 40 million followers. He made his TV debut this year on an episode of Nickelodeon's Unfiltered.</p><h2 id=lele-pons><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lele Pons</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her Vine days were over, Lele Pons has been enjoying quite a popularity on social media. She has 43 million followers on Instagram, as well as 23.3 million others on TikTok where she shares behind-the-stage videos of her dancing and her day-to-day life. She embraces her Latina identity proudly in her arts and has been keeping herself busy with her music career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why These 10 Celebrities Refused A Knighthood</a></span></p><h2 id=logan-paul><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Logan Paul</span></h2><p>Logan Paul's road to stardom wasn't a smooth one. Throughout his career, he's been the subject of repeated controversies, including the time when he showed a clip of his trip to the infamous "suicide forest" in Aokigahara, Japan. Now, he's been keeping himself busy with his boxing career and is gearing up for the upcoming "Bragging Rights" fight against Floyd Mayweather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shawn-mendes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shawn Mendes</span></h2><p>Many may have not known about this, but Shawn Mendes actually had a humble beginning on Vine. From 2013, the Canadian power singer used to post song covers on the platform before Andrew Gertler, an artist manager under Island Records, stumbled across one of his videos. Since then, Mendes has sold millions of records, gained three Grammy nominations and released four authentic studio albums.</p><h2 id=jake-paul><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jake Paul</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like his brother Logan, Jake Paul is also a controversial kind. As he rose to stardom with Vine, Disney gave him a contract to star on their Bizaardvark series. His Disney days were short-lived, though, as he later found himself involved with criminal trespassing. He's been focusing on his music career a lot more lately and also boxing here and there.</p><h2 id=liza-koshy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Liza Koshy</span></h2><p>Liza Koshy has found a big jump of success after Vine with her YouTube channel. Having amassed 17.7 million subscribers on the video-sharing platform, Koshy gives her fans a little sneak peek at her daily life through vlogs and commentaries. Career-wise, the Kids' Choice Award-winning star has made to Time's annual list of 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Vine Star, Rudy Mancuso?</a></span></p><h2 id=cameron-dallas><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cameron Dallas</span></h2><p>Cameron Dallas took Vine as a joke, but little did he know that it was actually the start of something greater. According to Telegraph, the Instagram star made approximately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$17,000 per a sponsored post.</a> Years after his debut on Vine, Dallas finally released his debut album, Dear Scarlett, in 2020.</p><h2 id=brittany-furlan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brittany Furlan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany Furlan used to hold the spot of the most followed female creator on Vine until November 2015. However, The American Meme star revealed that she's been struggling with depression ever since she rose to stardom.</p><p>“I didn’t want to keep pretending, ‘Oh, here’s another picture of me, my life’s great.’ I wanted to let people know that I have a lot going on in my brain that makes it really hard every day, and it’s not what you think it is," she told E! Entertainment in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a candid interview</a>.</p><h2 id=david-dobrik><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>David Dobrik</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lastly, there's David Dobrik who quickly jumped onto vlogging on YouTube as soon as his Vines videos took off. However, the YouTube star's career hasn't been a smooth ride lately, as he faced a series of sexual assault allegations this year. Since then, he's lost several sponsors, fans, and even his position at Dispo. Followed the allegation, YouTube decided to demonetize his channel and he hasn't made his return since then.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Shawn Mendes Wants People To Stop Asking Him This Question</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWgpL22uMCrZK%2Bhnpp6tMDAq6pmr5iav6Z5wKucZqyYmsZuus6wZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cardi-b-shows-off-jewelry-including-titanic-heart-diamond-ring.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cardi-b-shows-off-jewelry-including-titanic-heart-diamond-ring.html>Cardi B Shows Off Jewelry, Including 'Titanic' Heart Diamond Ring</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html>Why Dax Shepard's 'Bless This Mess' Got Canceled Despite The Ratings Going Up</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
