But which celebrities do their birthdays the best? Keep scrolling to find out who throws themselves the most extravagant party.</p><h2 id=erika-girardi>Erika Girardi</h2><p>Bravo has made an empire off of The Real Housewives shows. If you’ve ever watched a single episode, one thing we can all attest to is that these women know how to throw a party. Not only does Erika Jayne shop every day like it’s her birthday, but she also throws herself a killer birthday party.</p><p>Erika’s most iconic birthday party was for her 45th. Being a singer with chart-topping dance club music, it’s no surprise that she threw a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio-54 themed soiree.</a> Filled with sequins galore, plunging neck-lines, and astronomically teased hair: the party looked like an Andy Warhol painting that was brought to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-amp-ashley-olsen>Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen</h2><p>Even though the twins like to keep a low profile, there’s an exception to every rule. Specifically, this exception is their birthday. Their most genius idea: the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olsen Olympics. </a>The only thing more competitive than the left vs. right Twix is the Olsen twins.</p><p>Guests had to choose between “Team Ashley” and “Team Mary Kate.” The party was held in the Hamptons. After receiving customized red or blue team tees the Olympic bash began. This sibling rivalry was taken to extreme stakes as both teams competed in several obstacle courses and even sudden-death dunk tanks.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> reported&nbsp;that Team Ashely brought home the victory.</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p>Just living one day in the life of <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> would be a very happy birthday. So what does the man who never ages do to celebrate his extravagant life? It starts with the letter “m.” Leo and models is a classic pair like peanut butter and jelly. However, on his birthday his usual posse of ten surrounding models exponentially increases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only visually does DiCaprio have it covered, but his parties also deliver with star-studded entertainment. One of his birthday parties at TAO Nightclub in New York City had both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2-Chainz and Kayne West perform.</a> In his authentic activist form, he raised over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million</a> for his charity.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>Does anyone think of the word “party” without thinking of Lindsay Lohan? This party queen sets the bar high. The 2000s wouldn’t have been complete without the Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan post-party car picture. Apparently she also agrees since she sent out birthday invites via Twitter to not only that original crew but the best possible added guest: Beyoncé. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People all over the world tweeted to express their FOMO.</a></p><p>Lohan’s extravagance is locational bliss. Forget a destination wedding; Lohan has created the destination birthday. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her most recent birthday parties are held in Mykonos, Greece.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake>Drake</h2><p>What’s better than having one extravagant birthday party per year? Being a celebrity and throwing yourself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two extravagant birthday parties</a> in the same year. Rapper Drake just gave a whole new meaning to his hit lyrics, “back to back.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Musicians Of 2019</a></span></p><p>The first party had Rihanna as the DJ. He then gave his guests a McDonald’s feast. This is what dreams are made of. His second party was an ode to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sopranos</a> and old-school Italian mob era, which he wore a suave pinstripe suit. In some amazing twist of fate, he even had Adele there.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton>Paris Hilton</h2><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> holds the title for most extravagant birthday outfits to pair with her outrageous parties. Her 21st birthday silver sequined party dress with attached bedazzled choker never went out of style. For years, it’s been recreated by so many other celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This year she brought back this look with a modern flare. Thanks to her sister Nicky’s snapchat story, we saw an inside look at Paris’ chic party. It was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-Valentine’s Day themed</a> at Lavo in NYC. Not only was the ceiling filled with heart-shaped balloons, but Paris also used her crystal stilettos to smash a pink frosted heart-shaped cake.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</h2><p>It only makes sense that the word’s youngest self-made billionaire is on this list. After almost a year of a secret pregnancy, Kylie made sure to come back to her 21st birthday with a bang.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kylie Jenner's 10 Best Tweets Of 2019, Ranked</a></span></p><p>From her platinum blonde hair and pink crystal jumpsuit to a pink ball pit, and massive pink floral arrangements- it was the definition of a Barbie World. The room was filled with metallic pink balloons and at one point a sea of pink confetti fell from the ceiling. She even had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cups made in pink, red, yellow or green</a> which represented your relationship status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-john>Elton John</h2><p>On a regular day, Elton John’s costumes defy everything we’ve ever seen in the best possible way. Colored sunglasses deserve to be renamed after him. His birthdays are nothing short of his fabulous self.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Paid Musicians To Date</a></span></p><p>His 70th birthday was formatted as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">academy award show of Elton’s life.</a> Family and friends honored his greatest hits such as “Rocket Man,” “Tiny Dancer,” and many more in addition to all of his stellar life accomplishments. Elton took the night to make sure he expressed to his lavish guest lists the importance of the arts. He even received regal wishes via video from Prince Harry.</p><h2 id=sean-combs>Sean Combs</h2><p>Nothing could ever top this pregame: Sean Combs legitimately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skydived into the Playboy Mansion</a> and then had his birthday party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sean is the guy in high school that’s friends with everyone. His guest list even includes half the people on this list, Beyoncé and Jay Z, The Kardashians, Vin Diesel, Joe Jonas, Leonardo DiCaprio, etc. As if things aren’t cool enough, he also partially owns Ciroc vodka. His parties open bars are known to be the best of the best. He’s also known to launch a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new flavor</a> at his parties.</p><h2 id=floyd-mayweather>Floyd Mayweather</h2><p>When it comes to birthday parties, professional boxer Floyd Mayweather has done it all. He’s had A1 celebrity performances including Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber, Jamie Foxx and more. He’s had celebrities forcefully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">escorted</a> from his parties, aka Tyga. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reports that he’s even been sued by the SLS Hotel in Las Vegas for $35,000 for not showing up to his own party because he was partying in Europe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather is also the king of themes. Let’s start with his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 90’s themed birthday party </a>filled with sideways hats, dog-tag necklaces, and of course, tie-dye everything. Next, Floyd’s gone to the scandalous side with his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Shades of Grey birthday,</a> where he wore a black mask, blue-velvet suit and blinding diamond necklace. Not to mention he gifted himself with a brand-new private jet earlier that day. His most extravagant party, however, was labeled as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Bank of Mayweather.” </a>The club was adorned with blocks of gold and endless cash. Now that is how you throw an extravagant birthday party.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Top Richest Athletes In The World From 2009 To 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Keo56aop7BunnBoqmtoJSWxm68wKurop2jYrmiwsisn2abopbHunnEsaeepqOew6Z7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-throw-themselves-the-most-extravagant-birthday-parties.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-behind-the-scene-secrets-of-the-cast-of-dawson-s-creek.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-behind-the-scene-secrets-of-the-cast-of-dawson-s-creek.html>15 Behind-The-Scene Secrets Of The Cast Of Dawson's Creek</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-zac-efron-s-ex-girlfriend-vanessa-valladares-net-worth.html>What Is Zac Efron's Ex-Girlfriend Vanessa Valladares' Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-zac-efron-s-ex-girlfriend-vanessa-valladares-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
