Who is your best impression of? Your spouse, your boss, your mom, that one annoying coworker? Would you do your impression on live TV, knowing the person is probably going to see it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lots of celebs have a whole stable of impressions they can trot out on a dime, and with talk show segments like <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon's Wheel of Impressions</a></strong>, there's no shortage of videos of celebrities doing impressions. And unsurprisingly, when they nail it...they really nail it. Many of them do make their livings as actors, after all! There are too many great celebrity impressions to document them all here, but here are our absolute favorites - here are 10 celebrities who have nailed impressions of other celebrities.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-as-celine-dion><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ariana Grande As Celine Dion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana Grande has made quite <a href=#>a name for herself</a> doing impressions of other celebrities. Her ability to transform her voice and her affectations is extremely impressive, which makes her a gem of a guest on The Tonight Show segment, Wheel of Impressions, where Jimmy Fallon and the guest take turns spinning the wheel and doing an impression of the celebrity it lands on. Her Celine Dion is absolutely uncanny!</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-as-tracy-jordan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Alec Baldwin As Tracy Jordan</span></h2><p>When you work with someone for as long as Alec Baldwin has worked with Tracy Morgan, it only makes sense that you'd get pretty good at doing an impression of them. Don't you have impressions of your coworkers? The 30 Rock stars go way back, so if Tracy Morgan saw this, we're pretty sure he didn't mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-damon-as-matthew-mcconaughey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Matt Damon As Matthew McConaughey</span></h2><p>Matthew McConaughey has got to be one of the more fun celebrity impersonations to do. On The Late Show with David Letterman, Matt Damon puts on Matthew McConaughey's lilting speech, vocal fry, and Texan drawl to hilarious effect. Matt Damon explains that he used to hang out with him when they were "broke actors."</p><h2 id=sarah-paulson-as-kathleen-turner><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sarah Paulson As Kathleen Turner</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Is there anything Sarah Paulson can't do? Add celebrity impressions to her list of many, many talents. She killed it on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon during a game of Wheel of Impressions. Though Jimmy Fallon is a notoriously generous laugher, he was especially in stitches over her impression of Kathleen Turner, putting on a low, throaty voice to imitate the screen and stage veteran.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Losing It At SNL Star's Impression Of Megan Fox And Machine Gun Kelly</a></span></p><h2 id=maya-rudolph-as-gwen-stefani><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Maya Rudolph As Gwen Stefani</span></h2><p>In Ellen DeGeneres' impression game, Ellen holds up a picture of a celebrity over her own head so she herself cannot see it. She must guess the celebrity based on her guest's impression of who they see in the picture. This is no surprise, but SNL alum Maya Rudolph brought the house down, particularly in her impression of Gwen Stefani. The facial expressions alone are worth it, and her garbled singing voice is spot on too!<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Look Alike Goes Viral On TikTok For Her Rachel Green Impression</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-as-britney-spears><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Christina Aguilera As Britney Spears</span></h2><p>A lot of hype in the '90s was made about the Britney Spears vs. Christina Aguilera debate. Just like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, pitting them against each other in a dichotomous way was profitable; you were either a Christina person, or a Britney person. Now we know that the women never disliked each other no matter what the media would have us think, and Christina Aguilera felt no hesitation about doing an impression of her teen singer counterpart. For what it's worth, her Shakira impression is impressive too.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-as-jack-nicholson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jim Carrey As Jack Nicholson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim Carrey is one of the comedy greats for a reason, even if it's been a few years since he was in the limelight in any meaningful way. The man's face is super-human, capable of twisting and contorting in more directions than we thought a human face really could. So it's no wonder he's so good at impersonating other celebs. His impression of Jack Nicholson had audiences howling back when he was frequenting the standup stages.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-as-clint-eastwood><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bradley Cooper As Clint Eastwood</span></h2><p>Jimmy Fallon better watch his back - there are some pretty great impressions going on on Ellen's stage too. Bradley Cooper and Ellen DeGeneres share a funny anecdote about a routine Clint Eastwood has of feeding squirrels near the Ellen sound stage. Bradley Cooper has to get up from his chair on Ellen in order to give us a proper Clint Eastwood impression, and it's well worth the watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julie-bowen-as-sofia-vergara><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Julie Bowen As Sofia Vergara</span></h2><p>It's all love between <a href=#>Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara</a>, so when Julie Bowen did an impression of her Modern Family co-star on Ellen, she got the biggest laughs of all from Sofia herself. Imitation is the best form of flattery, right?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘The Mandalorian’ Star Bill Burr’s Wookie Impression Is Hilarious</a></span></p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-as-jimmy-fallon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Justin Timberlake As Jimmy Fallon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon have a <a href=#>well-documented friendship</a> and whenever they're together you can usually find them <a href=#>cracking each other up</a>. Jimmy Fallon got a taste of his own medicine when Justin Timberlake served up an impression of the late night host, whose show includes the signature Wheel of Impressions game.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 'SNL' Skit That Almost Deleted Jimmy Fallon's Career For Good</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhknJ2cmq%2B0edahpmagkauybrrAoqOenF2eurG%2BxKyqoqeeqHqwsoyoq6GdomKwprjEm6pmopmiurp5xZqjpaeeYsSpscSlZKieXZ66sb7ErKqip56ofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-have-nailed-impressions-of-other-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./12-of-the-heaviest-babies-ever-born.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./12-of-the-heaviest-babies-ever-born.html>12 Of The Heaviest Babies Ever Born</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-is-christopher-scarver-now-today.html>Where Is Christopher Scarver Now Today?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./where-is-christopher-scarver-now-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
