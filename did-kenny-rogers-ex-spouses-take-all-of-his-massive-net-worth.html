Sadly, even though a lot of people think that folks with money don’t have any problems, many celebrities haven’t been able to find success in their romantic efforts. As a result, there have been several examples of headlines about <a href=#>extremely costly divorces that involved major stars</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, there have been many country music performers who’ve enjoyed so much success that they’ve accumulated a massive fortune. For example, it is no secret that <a href=#>Dolly Parton has accumulated a lot of money</a> during her legendary country music career and that she has used her fortune to give back. Unlike his former “Islands in the Stream” partner, there never was a slew of headlines about Kenny Rogers’ philanthropic efforts before his 2020 passing. Perhaps the reason for that is many people have wondered whether or not Rogers lost his massive net worth due to all of the women he divorced over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dolly Parton, Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman And Many Others Gave Back In 2020</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kenny-rogers-was-unlucky-in-love-many-times>Kenny Rogers Was Unlucky In Love Many Times</h2><p>From the outside looking in, celebrities seem to have extremely cushy lives. In a lot of ways, that is very true which is why a lot of people find it hard to feel sorry for most stars. Despite that, there are a lot of aspects of being a celebrity that most people would struggle to cope with. For example, the vast majority of people would wither under the pressure of having the tabloids and paparazzi examining every aspect of their lives. On top of that, having a fleet of <a href=#>paparazzi taking pictures of very private moments</a> in your life is extremely hard to get used to. Given all of that pressure that stars and their spouses are under, it makes sense that many celebrities get divorced a lot.</p><p>Sadly for him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenny Rogers is a prime example of a celebrity that got divorced many times</a> since he walked down the aisle a lot and ended his marriages almost as often. After all, Rogers was married five times, divorced four times, and he had five children. Married for the first time when he was only 19-years-old, Rogers and Janice Gordon walked down the aisle in 1958 only for their union to be dissolved in 1960.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> I Do, I Do, I Don't: 10 Celebs With The Most Divorces In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Despite his first marriage coming to a relatively swift end, Kenny Rogers tied the knot a second time the same year he first got divorced. The second time around, Rogers’ marriage lasted a little bit longer as he and Jean Rogers were married from 1960 until 1963. Quick to move on yet again, Rogers married Margo Anderson in 1964 and remained with her through the first stages of his music career. Sadly, Rogers would later say that he was very happy with Anderson for many years and it was only after that he began touring a lot that things soured. That resulted in Rogers getting divorced a third time in 1976.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time Kenny Rogers got married a fourth time in 1977, he was really starting to become a star. Continuing the trend of Rogers’ marriages lasting longer over time, Marianne Gordon and the country crooner were able to make their marriage last a significant amount of time. Married to Rogers from 1977 until 1994, Gordon would later say that Kenny felt he was going through a mid-life crisis at the time of their divorce.</p><p>Unlike every other time Kenny Rogers got divorced, the famed musician waited a while to get hitched a fifth time. Perhaps his willingness to wait for love and the fact that he was in his fifties when he got married the last time is the reason Roger’s marriage to Wanda Miller went the distance. Married from 1997 until 2020, Miller and Rogers were still together when the beloved singer passed away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Paul McCartney & Other Celebs Who Got Married After They Turned 50</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-kenny-rogers-rsquo-ex-wives-take-all-of-his-money>Did Kenny Rogers’ Ex-Wives Take All Of His Money?</h2><p>By the time Kenny Rogers’ fourth marriage ended, he already was a country music superstar who was known for songs like “The Gambler”, “Lady”, and “Lucille” among others. As a result, Rogers was a very rich man when his marriage to Marianne Gordon ended in 1993. However, once Rogers and Gordon’s divorce was finalized, the singer was a lot less wealthy. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rogers and Gordon’s settlement was one of the most expensive</a> In pop culture history since she reportedly received $60 million. While that is a staggering number at first blush, it is all the more mind-boggling when adjusted for inflation since she was awarded that sum in 1993.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since one of Kenny Rogers’ divorces was extremely expensive and he had three other marriages end, it could be easy to conclude that his wives got all of his cash. In reality, however, that certainly wasn’t the case upon further examination. After all, Rogers’ three other divorces took place before he became so wealthy so his earlier ex-wives didn’t have a claim to his fortune at its heights. On top of that, Rogers made a lot of his money after his last divorce since Kenny Rogers Roasters was founded in 1991 and was hugely successful after his marriage to Marianne Gordon ended in 1993. For all of those reasons and his abilty to continue cashing in on his musical efforts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rogers was worth $250 million at the time of his passing</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Prince Wrote Music For Kenny Rogers!</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaernqzu8aeqaxlo6W8tr%2FEZqWerF2svLPAx2aboq6fp7CmecyaqaKZnqOybrPOq5uopl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kenny-rogers-ex-spouses-take-all-of-his-massive-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-do-jenny-and-dave-marrs-earn-details-about-their-net-worth-and-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-do-jenny-and-dave-marrs-earn-details-about-their-net-worth-and-kids.html>How Much Do Jenny And Dave Marrs Earn?
