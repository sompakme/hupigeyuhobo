He had a great audition but came to the table read, sat with his nose in the script, and mumbled the whole way through.”</p><p>Apparently, Lorne Michaels, the producer of Mean Girls, approached Waters after the table read and asked him to switch to their second choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Lorne Michaels] came over to me and said ‘That’s a shame, we’re going to have to go with that other guy.’ It was brutal and quick, but that ended up being a happy accident as Jonathan was amazing and brought a lot to that part.”</p><p>Turns out, <a href=#>brutal firings are part of the game when one is an actor in Hollywood</a>.</p><h2 id=it-was-not-james-franco>It Was Not James Franco</h2><p>A lot of people think the A-lister who got fired as Aaron Samuels was James Franco, but that's not true. He was being considered for the role but it went to the unnamed actor instead.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Cosmopolitan, Daniel Franzese</a> – who played Cady's friend Damien in Mean Girls – revealed this:</p><p>“I met Lindsay [at the cast meeting dinner], and Lacey Chabert too. I hit it off with everyone and I remember leaving, saying, 'I’ll see you all tomorrow at the table read. I’m the only one who doesn’t have the part yet,'” Franzese said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Jonathan Bennett wasn’t cast yet either. There was another actor who was playing Aaron Samuels at the dinner.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are James Franco's Worst Moments, According To Fans</a></span></p><p>Then he shared details about the cast's experience with the A-lister the next day.</p><p>“The next day at the table read, this other actor hadn’t shaved and he didn’t take his hat off; he was playing it really cool. People kept coming over to him like, 'You know, you should really take your hat off.' And then, right after the table read, he got fired and they called Jonathan Bennett, who I guess was their second choice.”</p><p>He didn't reveal who the actor was though.</p><p>“I don’t want to embarrass him, I’m afraid. He has worked consistently, he’s a good guy.”</p><p>Franzese emphasized though that it was not James Franco. Apparently, Lohan had shared with him that Franco was once considered for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Lindsay recently told me that, even before [the actor who got fired], James Franco was considered for the role of Aaron Samuels,” Franzese said. “I thought that was so cool.

But the role went to Rachel McAdams eventually.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rachel McAdams' Biggest Achievements Since 'The Notebook'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a different interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Waters revealed that he wanted to cast Lohan as Regina because of her “aggressive, testosterone-laden energy.”</a></p><p>“When I gave [Regina's role] to [Lindsay Lohan], she was like, ‘I f****** love Regina George! This is exactly the part I want to play.’ So we did a read-through, and we were trying to look for somebody to play the role of Cady, but frankly, we didn’t find anyone... who felt strong enough to go up against Lindsay.”</p><p>Lohan became really popular because of Freaky Friday around that time, and so he was advised to make her the lead instead of the villain.</p><p>And though one would think that Rachel McAdams was an obvious choice for Regina once Lohan got cast as Cady, that wasn't really the case. Amanda Seyfried was also on the consideration list. But McAdams beat her out, according to Waters, because the former was "more intimidating."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>McAdams was really dedicated to playing Regina and prepared for her role extensively</a> before filming.
