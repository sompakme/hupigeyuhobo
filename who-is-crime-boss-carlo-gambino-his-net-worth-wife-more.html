Born on <strong>August 24, 1902</strong>, in Palermo, Italy, Gambino immigrated to the United States at a young age and quickly rose to power within the Mafia, eventually becoming the head of the Gambino crime family.</p><p><strong>1902</strong>: Born on <strong>August 24</strong> in Palermo, Italy.</p><p><strong>1921</strong>: Immigrated to the United States.</p><p><strong>1957</strong>: Became the head of the Gambino crime family.</p><p><strong>1976</strong>: Died on November 15 at the age of 74.</p><p>During his time as the head of the Gambino crime family, Carlo Gambino became one of the most powerful and influential figures in organized crime. Despite numerous law enforcement efforts to bring him down, Gambino remained in power until he died in 1976. He remains a significant figure in the history of organized crime in the United States.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambinos_Childhood_and_Early_Life><strong>Carlo Gambino’s Childhood and Early Life:</strong></span></h3><p>On August 24, 1902, Carlo Gambino was born in Palermo, Sicily, into a family that belonged to the “Honored Society,” a more eloquent term for a loose confederation of organized criminals. Carlo is of Italian nationality. There is no detailed information about Carlo’s family members. While Carlo was growing up, President Benito Mussolini expelled most of the Mafia from the country. As a result, a higher class of criminals arose. Carlo benefited from the organized structure, and at the age of 19, he was inducted into the ‘Cosa Nostra,’ indicating that he was a “made man.” He was given the honour because he began murdering people when he was still in his teens.</p><p>Carlo also joined the ‘Young Turks,’ a band of many Italian Jewish mobsters, including Frank Scalice, Vito Genovese, and Joe Adonis. The majority of these gangsters went on to become powerful crime bosses later in life. Carlo passed away on October 15, 1976, from a heart attack. When he passed away, he was 74 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Carlo-Gambino-Age.webp><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambino_Professional_Life_and_Career><strong>Carlo Gambino Professional Life and Career</strong></span></h3><p>Carlo became involved in minor crimes like gambling, theft, and robbery as a member of the “Young Turks.” During “Prohibition” in the early 1920s, he also got involved in bootlegging. Carlo had become a dreaded mobster by the middle of the 1920s. Compared to the traditional mafia rulers, the “Young Turks” had a very different vision of how organized crime would develop. While the ancient mafia bosses were too proud of their Italian background, they believed that they would need to form alliances with more mafia factions if they wanted to do business in peace. Carlo prospered in the new mafia system because it was better organized and less violent. He continued engaging in illegal activities like gambling and extortion while developing schemes to make quick cash. He earned significant money illegally by selling Second World War ration stamps on the black market. Gambino was an employee of Albert Anastasia and had a very low-key criminal lifestyle. However, by the late 1950s, his boss had developed a severe eccentricity. He had turned violent to become extremely dangerous to the illegal house.</p><p>In 1957, Carlo emerged as the new Godfather of the family because there was no other candidate. Under his direction, the Gambino family increased its dominance nationwide and amassed enormous wealth. Carlo was earning hundreds of millions of dollars annually, further solidifying his position and elevating him to the status of one of the most potent crime lords in the entire nation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambino_Relationship><strong>Carlo Gambino Relationship</strong></span></h3><p>In 1926, Carlo wed Catherine Castellano. They raised four children: Thomas, Joseph (born in 1936 and died in 2020), Carlo (born in 1934), and Phyllis Gambino Sinatra, a daughter (September 22, 1927 – February 19, 2007).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambinos_Age_Height_and_Weight><strong>Carlo Gambino’s Age, Height, and Weight</strong></span></h3><p>Carlo Gambino’s approximate height is 5 feet 7 inches; however, his weight is unknown. From his photos, it can be inferred that he also had black eyes. In addition, Virgo appears to be his zodiac sign based on the time and day of his birth. He died at 74.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambinos_Net_Worth><strong>Carlo Gambino’s Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p>Carlo is one of the wealthiest and most well-known criminals. Analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes, and Business Insider estimate Carlo Gambino’s net worth to be over $400 million.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Carlo_Gambinos_Social_Media><strong>Carlo Gambino’s Social Media</strong></span></h3><p>Carlo appears relatively private; therefore, not much is known about him. Carlo doesn’t seem to utilize social networking sites, so perhaps there weren’t as many back then as now. To respect his privacy, there is no comprehensive information about his personal life.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><li>Carlo</li><li>is one of the
