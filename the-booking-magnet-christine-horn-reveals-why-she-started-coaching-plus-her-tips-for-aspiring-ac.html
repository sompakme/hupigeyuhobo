That was in 2017, so Facebook Live was still new, but I would do Lives and YouTube videos about my day, my auditions ... and then I started giving tips to anyone who was watching."</p><p>Soon enough, her audience began to grow, and Christine even racked up some regular viewers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: 'Hawkeye' Star Adetinpo Thomas On Why She Left Business For Acting</a></span></p><p>Eventually, those loving her tips wanted more.</p><p><strong>"People started asking if I'd coach them, and I was like, 'I like money - sure!'"</strong> she laughs.</p><p>"It got to a point where I realized, I'm definitely connected to media, and I'm an entrepreneur at heart - so when I see an opportunity, I'm not blind to it."</p><p><strong>"From there, it just grew, and not just on the coaching side.

I read books on how to be a better person - and the more connected you are to yourself as a human being, the more tapped in you can be for your characters, or for anything!"</p><p><strong>"So," </strong>she smiles, concluding our conversation, <strong>"You will never go wrong with changing your thoughts.
