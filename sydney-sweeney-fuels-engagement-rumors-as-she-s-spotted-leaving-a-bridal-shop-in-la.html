There have been rumors going around that she was engaged to boyfriend Jonathan Davino ever since <strong>she was spotted with a ring on her wedding finger back in 2022</strong>, but a lot has happened since then.</p><p>In 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Glen Powell sparked affair rumors</a> after being extremely flirty with each other while doing press for their movie Anyone But You.</p><p>A particular exchange that caused outrage was when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glen Powell said suggestively</a> "We love seeing ourselves on the big screen." The Euphoria star replied sarcastically, "Oh please, Top Gun," referring to the actor's famous role in Top Gun: Maverick, and without missing a beat, Glen replied, "<strong>I love it when she calls me that</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About a year ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video went viral of Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell</a> being very touchy with each other. <strong>Sydney was practically on his lap</strong> and he tilted her back, holding her with his arms around her back. Notoriously, <strong>the actress was not wearing the ring that sparked the engagement rumors in the first place</strong>.</p><p>Shortly after, Glen Powell broke up with his then-girlfriend, and according to a source, it was a huge blow to Jonathan Davino. "It was an open secret they’d gotten really close," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the insider said</a>, describing the rumors going around as a "nightmare" for him and saying that it was "without a doubt <strong>a huge test of their relationship</strong>."</p><p>Now, however, it seems things are back on track for them. Sydney Sweeney came out of the bridal shop carrying a garment bag, so the wedding might be happening sooner than people think.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-about-marriage>Sydney Sweeney About Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jonathan-davino-sydney-sweeney.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the engagement rumors first came up, Sydney Sweeney spoke candidly about what she was looking for in a partner, and it seems Jonathan Davino checks all the boxes.</p><p>"<strong>I don’t date people in the spotlight. I don’t date actors or musicians</strong> or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it’s easiest. I have a great support system," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said to Cosmopolitan</a>. Jonathan is a producer, and as such, keeps mostly behind the scenes, which Sydney Sweeney.</p><p>"I have people who will battle for me and allow me to be on the pedestal and shine without making me feel like, 'Oh no, I’m shining too bright and I need to step back.'"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2441.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sydney Sweeney’s Bold Comments About Her Chest Reveal Her True Relationship With Her Body">Sydney Sweeney’s Bold Comments About Her Chest Reveal Her True Relationship With Her Body</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sydney Sweeney posted on social media about her chest and proved how she feels about her physical appearance.</p><p>The 26-year-old actress also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked to GLAMOUR</a> about how she imagines marriage and family, and she said it was a long way away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<strong>I’d be crazy if I had a kid or got married before I’m 30</strong>," she stated last year.
