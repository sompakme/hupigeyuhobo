Bey continued to dominate the charts with worldwide tours, high-budget music videos while partnering with companies for lucrative endorsement deals, such as L’Oreal and Nintendo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rowland, on the other hand, who released her sophomore album Ms. Kelly in 2007, didn’t see the same kind of support from fans with her project, which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 200 and only sold 86,000 copies in its first week.</p><p>The album wasn’t well-received with critics; it also didn’t produce any commercial songs, and subsequently saw Rowland part ways with Columbia Records.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z Treats Wife Beyoncé To A Luxury Dinner In Italy In Newly Emerged Pictures</a></span></p><p>The 39-year-old’s career had slowed down after Destiny’s Child, which meant less exposure and certainly less money, which Rowland said was hard to come to terms with considering how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had been living a certain lifestyle</a> while traveling on the road as part of DC.</p><p>In an interview with pastor Erwin McManus in June 2020, the Down For Whatever star explained: “I watched my mum be a generous person. I watched her give her very last. I watched her give with faith, and I would be thinking ‘Where am I gonna eat?!’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Even going through my own time where there was a lot of – no one will believe this and it’ll actually be the first time I talk about it – where I almost lost everything because I was so busy trying to keep up.</p><p>“Whether it was the look, whether it was the wardrobe, whether it was the car, whether it was the place, whether it was the – you know what I mean? All that silliness.”</p><p>Rowland then went on to mention how a friend had told her she needed to give to others to receive favorable returns, even though she was running out of money herself at the time.</p><p>But she decided to take her pal’s advice, and within a week, her financial status was beginning to stabilize.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She’s Crazy In Love: Beyoncé’s First 10 Songs As A Solo Artist</a></span></p><p>“Literally the following week, things just started to happen. Good things.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s also fair to assume that Rowland probably felt pressure to live up to a certain lifestyle based on how fans viewed her - after all, she was part of one of the biggest girl groups alongside Beyonce, who is reportedly said to be worth $400 million.</p><p>Seeing someone like Bey pay millions of dollars for music videos, grossing hundreds of millions on tour, and purchasing real estate all over the United States could definitely make someone as close as Rowland is to Beyonce feel pressure to live up to those standards. too.</p><p>Fortunately enough, the mother-of-one has gotten much better with her finances over the years, and aside from her music career, she’s even fronted several endorsement campaigns with Caress and Jaguar, appeared on several talent shows as a judge - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which earns her millions in revenue</a> - so it doesn’t seem as if Rowland will run into any money problems again anytime soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Best Celebrity Appearances In Beyoncé’s Black Is King</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLKtuNhmqaivnJa7pXnApaSoq6RitLB5waumpJ1dl8ZuwNGyoKefXam8brfEnqdmraBixKrAx2aZnrGfo7Cmv4yloJ%2Bdo6nGrbGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kelly-rowland-almost-go-broke-by-trying-to-keep-up-with-beyonce-s-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eunice-dwumfour-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eunice-dwumfour-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Eunice Dwumfour Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./darren-waller-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Darren Waller Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./darren-waller-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
