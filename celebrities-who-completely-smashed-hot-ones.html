The show started off with humble beginnings yet with some big names that made for classic episodes like DJ Khalid and Machine Gun Kelly. The show has also hosted some of the biggest names ever in music and in Hollywood like Post Malone, Natalie Portman, Gordon Ramsay and way more. Out of all the celebrities that fans loved seeing on the show, here are some of the ultimate fan favorite interviews on Hot Ones!</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-started-a-long-hot-ones-tradition><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>DJ Khaled Started A Long Hot Ones Tradition</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DJ Khaled was on of the very first celebrities to be featured on Hot Ones as he made it in the season premiere of the show. With DJ Khaled may have a "take no Ls" mentality, but he sure did on his very short-lived appearance on the show. Out of generally 10 standard rounds, DJ Khaled tapped out right after round two, not even making it to the interview's 5-minute mark. His underwhelming appearance made fans critique him on Reddit and <a href=#>some consider this another reason to his declining popularity</a>. After this episode, fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launched the Hot Ones hall of shame</a> and the off the bone rule that only real hardcore followers know about today.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Don’t Know How To Feel As A Shirtless DJ Khaled Dances To Drake’s ‘Way 2 Sexy’">Fans Don’t Know How To Feel As A Shirtless DJ Khaled Dances To Drake’s ‘Way 2 Sexy’</a></span></p><h2 id=joji-showed-fans-another-side-on-the-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Joji Showed Fans Another Side On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Joji had his time as a famous YouTuber in his own right</a>, so his time on Hot Ones probably felt as natural as ever. The singer does not usually do many interviews, so when fans got his solo one on one with Sean Evans, they were happy to get a glimpse of who he is as a person after breaking his YouTube character. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has another Hot Ones interview with fellow label mate Rich Brian</a>, but fans can't wait to see him return to the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Joji Became The Musician He Is Now">How Joji Became The Musician He Is Now</a></span></p><h2 id=billie-eilish-was-everything-that-fans-wanted><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Billie Eilish Was Everything That Fans Wanted</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish is a <a href=#>chart topping music phenomenon that took the world by storm</a> when she was just 17.
