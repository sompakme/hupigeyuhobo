Instead, to make ends meet, Clarkson took whatever jobs she could after she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> career.

Clarkson's net worth has come a long way since working at a pizza place pre-fame as well. But even with the fortune that Clarkson has earned, it is clear that it is in Clarkson's nature to have many pokers in the fire to ensure that she remains monetarily comfortable with the life she has built for herself.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-had-various-jobs-before-she-was-famous>Kelly Clarkson Had Various Jobs Before She Was Famous</h2><h3 id=at-one-point-kelly-clarkson-was-holding-down-four-jobs-to-make-ends-meet>At one point, Kelly Clarkson was holding down four jobs to make ends meet</h3><p>Clarkson decided before she graduated from high school that she was not going to go to college. She had seen those who were ahead of her in school go the college route and still not achieve their dreams.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For Clarkson, college would be the backup plan</a>. Moving to Los Angeles was how Clarkson saw herself rising to fame and becoming a singer. But to afford to live in Southern California, Clarkson had to hold down several jobs, some of which proved to be better than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had a lot of older friends that I watched go to college and just waste their time," Clarkson explained. "… I knew that I’d rather go out and almost like an apprentice-style, just start doing background vocals for people and then just kind of work my way up. So I chose to move to L.A. randomly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar49972596-1.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Clarkson was given a scholarship to go to college, she did not feel it was the path that was meant for her. However, it was the backup plan if moving to Los Angeles did not work.</p><p>"You can always go back to school. And even if I didn’t get a scholarship, I already had like four jobs," Clarkson said. "I hustled to make money because I had to for my car, gas."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarkson went on to say, "So, I don’t know, I’ve just always known it’ll work out as long as you’re working your a** off."</p><p>Working hard is exactly what Clarkson did because she had "nothing to her name."</p><p>"I worked at Six Flags — I did the singing and dancing, like all those shows," Clarkson stated.

I’ve worked at a Papa John’s. I’ve worked at a Subway." All of this was done to make enough money for her demo, which Clarkson cut so that she could shop it around to labels.</p><p>But before Clarkson could make a name for herself in Los Angeles, her apartment burned down; <a href=#>Clarkson had to live in her car</a>.

This is because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarkson has a net worth of $50 million</a>. Clarkson lost money when she went through a messy divorce from Brandon Blackstock. <a href=#>Going through a divorce negatively impacted Clarkson's net worth</a>.</p><p>But it is that same tenacity that Clarkson had when she was a starving artist that has allowed Clarkson to come back from being personally knocked down to build her empire to be even more successful than it was when she was married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50338069-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To build her net worth, Clarkson relied on her singing career. An incredibly successful career. From selling over 25 million albums and 45 million singles, winning a dozen Billboard Awards and three Grammy Awards, Clarkson became a powerhouse in the music industry.</p><p>Clarkson proved that she is still a force to be reckoned with, after she released her latest album, Chemistry, in 2023. The tenth album release for Clarkson debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and sold over 43,000 copies in the first week.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:13</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kelly-clarkson-had-terrible-mental-health-struggles-before-and-after-her-extremely-public-divorce-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson Had Terrible Mental Health Struggles Before And After Her Extremely Public Divorce ">Kelly Clarkson Had Terrible Mental Health Struggles Before And After Her Extremely Public Divorce</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While Kelly Clarkson had a challenging time after her divorce, she also struggled with her mental health years before.</p><p>However, it is not just the music industry where Clarkson has built her net worth.

However, given that she was a hot commodity, American Idol also came calling, wanting to use Clarkson and her fame to relaunch the show after it was canceled on Fox.</p><p>"We’re used to The Voice schedule, we already have to work around it because of our family," Clarkson said in 2018 when married to Blackstock. "We have four children — that can be very taxing with a schedule. It was just a no-brainer for me with The Voice because of that alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarkson would stay on The Voice from Season 14 through Season 21 and would return for Season 23. This was an easy choice for Clarkson, as not only did she love being on the show, but it paid well. Clarkson made $560,000 per episode, which, according to Celebrity Net Worth, worked out to be $14 million per season.</p><p>However, this is not the most lucrative job that Clarkson has had since breaking into the entertainment industry. That honor goes to Clarkson's hosting duties on The Kelly Clarkson Show. This is the case after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarkson successfully renegotiated her contract in 2021</a> to receive $1.9 million per month as host and executive producer of the show. That equates to nearly $20 million per year.</p><p>While Clarkson may have had to hold down several jobs at a time to make ends meet when she was younger, it was that drive that got Clarkson to where she is today. With her appeal not diminishing since her American Idol win in 2002, Clarkson will only continue to grow her net worth. The sky is the limit for Clarkson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqkuMCroqynnmK7psCMsKarrJhitLO71q2fZquZo7CmecGenaiqlWKzornEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-s-net-worth-has-come-a-long-way-since-her-surprising-pre-fame-job.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./macklemore-s-thrift-shop-named-billboard-s-hottest-rap-song-ever.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./macklemore-s-thrift-shop-named-billboard-s-hottest-rap-song-ever.html>Macklemores Thrift Shop Named Billboards Hottest Rap Song Ever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jinni-nmixx-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Jinni Nmixx Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jinni-nmixx-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
