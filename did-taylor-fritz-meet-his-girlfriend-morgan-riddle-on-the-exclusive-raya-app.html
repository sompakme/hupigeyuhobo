According to SportsKeeda, they met on the dating app Raya. The app is an exclusive, membership-based app that was launched in 2015 and is known to be <a href=#>used by some of the hottest celebrities</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Serena Williams Is Retiring From Tennis</a></span></p><p>To become a part of the community, you need to be <a href=#>referred by another member</a>. There has been much chatter about the use of Raya, but most who do use it like to keep this information on the down low, which makes it all the more mysterious and interesting. So, what made Riddle want to give Fritz a chance? Could it have been his good looks? His impressive skills on the tennis court? No, it was much simpler than that, as the publication claims Riddle swiped right because of a similarity in a song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My song was 'Sunflower' by Harry Styles and his was 'Sunflower' by Post Malone and Swae Lee," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taylor-fritz-tennis-interview.jpg><p>Their relationship started during the lockdowns, so it was several weeks before they could reportedly meet in person, and when they did, SportsKeeda notes that they had sushi at Fritz's apartment. In the years that have followed, their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship appears to have gone from strength to strength</a>.</p><h2 id=was-morgan-riddle-a-fan-of-taylor-fritz-before-they-dated>Was Morgan Riddle A Fan Of Taylor Fritz Before They Dated?</h2><p>You may be inclined to think that Morgan Riddle knew who Taylor Fritz was <a href=#>before they started dating</a>. After all, he is a serious tennis player and his career has been reaching new heights; it seemed he was destined to become a big name in the industry as he is the son of two former tennis players, Kathy May and Guy Fritz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But back to Riddle, she did not know who Fritz was before their meeting, and she was not a big fan of the game in general. According to Town & Country, she grew up in a family that was focused on hockey. She is also originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, although now she travels the world attending her boyfriend's tournaments and documenting them for social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ben Stiller Dragged Into Tennis Player's On-Court Rant</a></span></p><p>While her knowledge of the tennis industry has likely improved since dating Fritz, when they first got together she will be the first to tell you that she "didn't know a thing." In an interview with ATPTour.com, she explained that while she knew of Rodger Federer she had not even heard of Spanish professional tennis Rafael Nadal, who has been ranked world No. 1 and is a 22-time Grand Slam singles winner. It is also interesting to note that she definitely knows Nadal's name now, because, in 2022, Taylor Fritz defeated Nadal at the Indian Wells Masters, which led to him achieving his Masters' title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taylor-fritz-playing-tennis.jpg><p>"I literally didn't know anything about it. But I know a lot now. I would consider myself a tennis expert at this point, I really would," she shared. Her comments on the sport would be enough to suggest that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Riddle was not interested in Fritz because of his status</a> as a sportsman. But that has not stopped her from using her own platform on social media to share her experience of tennis with the world. A move that Fritz approves of.</p><p>"Anything that she does that brings more attention to tennis is good," he told Town & Country. "In the U.S., I think tennis has a lot of work to do to be a more popular sport that younger people wanna watch and wanna follow." He could have a point, and if ever a young audience needed a tennis power couple, these two could be it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-is-morgan-riddle-making-tennis-become-cool>How Is Morgan Riddle Making Tennis Become Cool?</h2><p>Let's be honest, Taylor Fritz is putting in the hard work to make tennis become cool for the younger generation. But Morgan is certainly doing her part by sharing the content of his tournaments. The couple has been able to use technology to their advantage in more than one way (meeting each other online and also helping to make young people in America more aware of the beauty of the game). Morgan Riddle is a social media influencer with a following of over 100,000. She uses her platform to share her life, but also to help Fritz, and tennis in general, become better known.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riddle has a viral video about making "tennis cool again" but not everyone was impressed with the results. Fritz commented on the video during a press conference at the 2022 Indian Wells Masters tournament (via People).</p><p>"I think what she did was awesome for our sport. It got a ton of people looking at it," he said. "I think you get your typical older fan who may be upset about it. I don't understand how anyone can get upset about it. I'm the one that's a professional tennis player, I'm the one that does this for a living. I 100 percent agree with everything in that video."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Tennis Superstar Maria Sharapova Stays In Shape</a></span></p><p>So, not everyone is a fan of Riddle, but her boyfriend's willingness to publicly defend her shows how serious he is about their relationship. Their pairing has also been over two years, and it seems serious. Social media will give you a glimpse into their lives, including sweet pictures and captions. If you want to discover even more about them, you can also watch the Netflix docuseries, Break Point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9ustGiq7Nll56%2FrbLRopynnF2ivLOzwKdkq6GUmbmmecyeq2annmKxosDIp55mmaClerOt2Jpm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-taylor-fritz-meet-his-girlfriend-morgan-riddle-on-the-exclusive-raya-app.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-is-vanna-white-son-education-details-on-nikko-santo-pietro-explored.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-is-vanna-white-son-education-details-on-nikko-santo-pietro-explored.html>How Old Is Vanna White Son?
