And there's definitely more to him than portraying Officer Franklin.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What The Cast Of 'The Hangover' Really Thought About Doing A Sequel</a></span></p><p>Although, being an officer might not be that strange for Riggle when he's on set. After all, before he started up a career in comedy, he had another professional path that was more like his police officer alter-ego.</p><p>Before he really became famous as an actor, Riggle was a military man. In fact, he spent a full 23 years in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, before retiring in 2003, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>. While he wasn't on active duty the entire time, Lieutenant Colonel Rob Riggle worked his way up the ranks during his tenure as a Marine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not the only actor with an interesting day job</a>, but Riggle might be the only comedian to have been a formerly steely-glared Officer of the United States Marines.</p><p>But even before he joined up, Rob had dreams of becoming a comedian. In fact,&nbsp;ABC News quoted him as saying, "the comedy seeds were planted before the Marine seeds."</p><p>He was 43 when he retired, though he remained on the acting scene, of course, and he did partake in plenty of roles during those years. Plus, nine of the years he was in the military involved active duty.</p><p>Riggle explained that it's not even weird to him to wear both hats at alternate times. He elaborated, "I don't think anybody is just one thing." But it sure is strange for fans to picture the stand-up comedian and college theater graduate as a Marine and pilot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he ever tossed a joke out on stage, Riggle was already earning his pilot's license, even if his dreams weren't about earning his wings but rather, earning laughs from an appreciative audience.</p><p>The dual careers worked together, though; Riggle worked on his comedy while he was deployed, and he even used some of his fellow Marines as inspiration for characters and jokes. Not that they'd think it was hilarious -- or, they might not admit that it was while in uniform.</p><p>And these days, Rob seems pretty far removed from his serious past. After all, he's hosting 'Holey Moley' wearing plaid pants and a banana-colored jacket; that's very different from his military garb. Rob doesn't appear to mind, though -- he's embracing this stage of his life just like he did his earlier career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How 'The Daily Show' Host Trevor Noah Amassed His Mammoth $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edGomWaqmZy0rbGMm5yfp6KaeqmxjKyrmqqkmrFurcKtoKefXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-rob-riggle-was-doing-before-becoming-an-actor.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./topher-grace-s-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./topher-grace-s-net-worth-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html>Topher Graces Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sydney-sweeney-fuels-engagement-rumors-as-she-s-spotted-leaving-a-bridal-shop-in-la.html>Sydney Sweeney Fuels Engagement Rumors As She's Spotted Leaving A Bridal Shop In LA</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sydney-sweeney-fuels-engagement-rumors-as-she-s-spotted-leaving-a-bridal-shop-in-la.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
