Doris F. Fisher, 34.8% of net worth = $800 million worth of art</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doris Fisher is someone else who, like David Geffen, was able to mix creativity and business with immense success.&nbsp; A co-founder of The Gap (her husband being the other founder), Fisher has also been named one of the 100 Most Powerful Women by Forbes and by our account would be named the most powerful female art collector and an influence on the art scene.&nbsp; Her collection is vast, containing more than 1000 works by nearly 200 different artists and is worth $800 million.&nbsp; Even better is that Fisher has decided not to keep these works hidden away amongst various estate properties, but instead has decided to exhibit her work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in a new wing for all to enjoy.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-norman-braman-56-3-of-net-worth-900-million-worth-of-art><strong>3. Norman Braman, 56.3% of net worth = $900 million worth of art</strong></h2><p>The man who has sold pharmaceutical products and cars and was once the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles is also a regular attendee of Art Basel.&nbsp; Over the years, Norman Braman and his wife have collected artworks by remarkable artists such as Picasso, Alexander Calder, and Andy Warhol.&nbsp; However, they are not only about big names; they are incredibly knowledgeable about art and know their own taste well.&nbsp; They are only satisfied with a piece if they regard it as a strong work by the artist and if they are certain they can live with it (in one of their many homes).&nbsp; Not content to simply remain art collectors, the Bramans also assisted in establishing Art Basel in Miami.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-nasser-khalili-93-0-of-net-worth-930-million-worth-of-art><strong>2.&nbsp; Nasser Khalili, 93.0% of net worth = $930 million worth of art</strong></h2><p>Nasser Khalili, a scholar and former art dealer, clearly believes that the best investment is art.&nbsp; An international man of mystery, he is an Iranian-born British citizen that for some time was believed to be managing the art collection of the Sultan of Brunei, the richest man in the world, but this was denied and only increased his aura of mystery.&nbsp; A 20,000 piece collection of Islamic art makes Khalili’s one of the biggest private collections in the world, and he regularly loans pieces to museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) and the British Museum (London).&nbsp; As if sharing his magnificent collection weren't enough, he also lectures at universities and is the chair of his own department at the University of London, Islamic Art and Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies.&nbsp; With $930 million of his $1 billion net worth invested in art, Nasser Khalili is by far our most ardent and knowledgeable art collector.&nbsp; His collection, knowledge, and passion are simply unparalleled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-david-lawrence-geffen-20-0-of-net-worth-1-1-billion-worth-of-art><strong>1.&nbsp; David Lawrence Geffen, 20.0% of net worth = $1.1 billion worth of art</strong></h2><p>There is no question that David Geffen has always had an interest in the arts.&nbsp; As a film and record producer, and most notably as one of the creators of DreamWorks, Geffen has ensured that his legacy in the music and film industries will live on for quite some time.&nbsp; However, not one to put all of his eggs into one industry, he began collecting fine art at a young age and has never ceased. &nbsp;&nbsp;With 20 percent of his net worth invested in art, his art collection is valued at $1.1 billion, a staggering amount and definitely the highest valued collection in the world.&nbsp; He receives credit for being an early collector of artists like Pollock and de Kooning, and for owning the record-breaking&nbsp;<i>No. 5, 1948</i>&nbsp;by Jackson Pollock, a painting that he sold &nbsp;in 2006 for $140 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2glWKCbq7IoJ6eq6Rir6q4y6Kmp5mZp7JurdGtZJynnKGypMDIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-of-the-biggest-billionaire-art-collections.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ariana-grande-sends-selena-gomez-ice-cream-shaped-flowers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ariana-grande-sends-selena-gomez-ice-cream-shaped-flowers.html>Ariana Grande Sends Selena Gomez Ice Cream-Shaped Flowers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
