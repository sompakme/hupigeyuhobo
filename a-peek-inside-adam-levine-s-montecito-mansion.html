After meeting his members at the Brentwood School, he formed a band called Kara’s Flowers which later became Maroon 5. Since the release of <a href=#>Maroon 5’s debut album, the band has made 30 million in album sales</a> and embarked on multiple tours worldwide. Through his music, reality singing show, and business ventures, he has garnered a <a href=#>whopping $160 million fortune</a>. The singer not only spends his millions on expensive cars but also loves to invest in real estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A native of Los Angeles, Adam Levine has purchased several properties on the West Coast, and his portfolio extends from bachelor pads to cozy family homes. His latest real estate buy is a Montecito mansion once owned by Rob Lowe, known for flipping stunning houses. Let’s take a look inside his breathtaking home.</p><h2 id=a-custom-built-estate>A Custom Built Estate</h2><p>Called Oakview, the property was a plain land in 2005 when Rob Lowe and his wife purchased it for an undisclosed amount. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, they built a home that spanned 10,000 square feet, which took inspiration from Lowe’s childhood in the Virginian countryside. It boasts several structures from his hometown with a modern flair. After living on the property for more than fifteen years, they sold it in 2020 to a private healthcare executive Jack McGinley and his family for $44.5 million. In 2022, the house returned to the market, and Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo bought it for $42 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Adam Levine's Lavish Real Estate Portfolio</a></span></p><p>The home underwent menial changes with the McGinley family, and <a href=#>Levine has yet to make any tweaks and changes of his own</a>. The grand home has a long gravel driveway that leads to the entry gates. Upon entrance, Oakview offers a unique balance of venue and home. The wide open spaces and doors allow plenty of sunlight to shed into each room. As a space of refining and comfort, Oakview has intricate moldings, custom millwork, and wood flooring. It has a grand living room and multiple cozy nooks to sit and relax, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Culture</a>.</p><h2 id=lavish-inside-and-out>Lavish Inside And Out</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Featuring eight bedrooms and six bathrooms, the Montecito mansion also includes three powder rooms for guest use while hosting big parties. The kitchen comes with an eat-in family area and stainless steel kitchen appliances. One of the seating rooms in Oakview also functions as a built-in library, while the outdoor seating area has a fireplace. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, the mansion has a recreation area on the second floor with a game room and home theater.</p><p>The home has multiple other amenities, including an extensive wine cellar, a catering kitchen, an informal dining area, a formal dining room, and a wet bar. The primary suite also features hardwood floors that match the spotless white décor. It has multiple balconies around the home and a separate guest room with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The room has numerous seating areas and a balcony to enjoy the outdoor views. Attached to the room is a walk-in closet that is as big as one of the guest rooms with a marble-finished white cabinet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-oasis-in-la>An Oasis In LA</h2><p>Outdoors, Oakview is <a href=#>equally marvelous as the interior inside</a>. It has an outdoor living room equipped with a fireplace and a large swimming pool with a hot tub. Multiple loungers are splayed around the pool, with an adjoining one-bedroom pool house. The large backyard is divided into an open lawn area and a tennis court. The open lawn has a fountain at its edge and ample space to host large gatherings for guests. The tennis court is perfectly built, with multiple viewing platforms from each side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 3.5-acre of land is a picturesque home that provides soaring views of the blue Pacific ocean, Santa Ynez Mountains, and the Channel Islands, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Each room in the home offers equally stunning views. This isn’t the only property owned by Levine and Prinsloo in Montecito, as he also purchased the El Miraval Estate in 2021 for $22.7 million. The property was constructed in the 1920s by famed architect George Washington Smith. The villa-style home was on a 5.2-acre land, a little larger than the newer purchase.</p><p>Oakview is one of the coziest properties in Montecito and comes with many amenities and recreational features, including a pool and tennis court. Each room in the mansion follows the Virginia theme and blends with modern décor. As Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo extend their family, the couple will enjoy raising their children in the large mansion.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>John Wick's Garage: 10 Crazy Expensive Motorcycles In Keanu Reeves' Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Culture</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYq6lrcxmo56umaOytHnMqKWtnZOewbB5zJqlrKGfo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-adam-levine-s-montecito-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dashiell-weinstein-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dashiell-weinstein-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Dashiell Weinstein Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-has-a-higher-net-worth-in-2020-jennifer-aniston-or-brad-pitt.html>Who Has A Higher Net Worth In 2020: Jennifer Aniston Or Brad Pitt?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-has-a-higher-net-worth-in-2020-jennifer-aniston-or-brad-pitt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
