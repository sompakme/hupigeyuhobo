For instance, there are the financial gains that almost always come along with it. But on top of that, you are afforded opportunities and life experiences that few ever receive. However, that doesn’t mean that all of it is good as there is so much pressure that comes along with being in the public eye that it is hard to measure. Among those is the fact that a lot of these careers force people to keep their figures in tiptop shape either for cosmetic or practical reasons. As a result of this, there are a lot of celebrities that relax in this regard once they no longer feel that this is so important. Realizing that is what inspired us to put together this list of twenty celebrities whose looks went to crap after leaving the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order for someone to be considered for possible inclusion on this list, he/she first and foremost needs to have been well-known to a certain group of people. For our purposes, it doesn’t matter what he/she did to earn a name for himself/herself as long as he/she has&nbsp;done so, which means that you may find actors, athletes, “reality” stars, or several other types of people here. Next, this person’s public profile needs to have lessened to a certain degree, meaning he/she is no longer as famous as he/she once was. However, he/she can still be followed by a smaller group. Finally, since his/her time in the spotlight diminished, he/she needs to have undergone a transformation in the looks department that can be seen as negative by some.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=axl-rose><strong>Axl Rose</strong></h2><p>The lead singer and frontman of a band that many consider to be one of the best rock acts of all time, Guns N' Roses, <a href=#>Axl Rose</a> spent years touring the world playing music for adoring fans. Instead of appreciating that fact and treating his fans with the respect they deserved, he instead exhibited diva behavior over the years and caused several riots because of it instead. Then, the group came to an end amidst rumors that it was Axl that was at the root of much of the discord that would tear them asunder. Once it was announced that they were coming back in the late nineties and early two thousands, this singer was accompanied by a slew of random people. By that point nowhere near the star he once was, after a short period of people paying attention to him, he was ignored once more except for those that took note of his expanding stomach and horrible hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=renee-zellweger><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong></h2><p>One of the most respected actors of her generation, let alone of all time, <a href=#>Renee Zellweger</a> became a star due to her part in the movie Jerry Maguire, but she went on to much more. Best known for her roles in films like the Bridget Jones series, Cold Mountain, Cinderella Man, and several others, her work has meant a great deal to many people over the years. Also highly celebrated in the past, she has taken home trophies at the Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, the Film Critic Awards, and many more. Surprisingly gone from the scene after she appeared in a 2010 movie, she would next show up in a couple of 2016 projects. During the intervening years undergoing a transformation of sorts, when she appeared on a red carpet for the first time in years, she looked so different that many didn’t recognize her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-connery><strong>Sean Connery</strong></h2><p>Without a doubt one of the biggest movie stars in the world for many generations, <a href=#>Sean Connery</a> has a complicated legacy due to some troubling statements, but he had an incredible film career. Forever best known as the man that popularized the character James Bond, if he hadn’t been so marvelous in the role, it is easy to imagine that it wouldn’t be one of the best-known movie personalities around. Also a part of a long list of other flicks, he will go down in history for films like Time Bandits, The Untouchables, Highlander, and The Hunt for Red October among many others. Opting to retire after an awful experience filming The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in the years since, he stepped away the man has aged remarkably, which is natural but still surprising.</p><h2 id=nicole-eggert><strong>Nicole Eggert</strong></h2><p>An actor that people first took note of early in her life, this former child star became a star when she was cast in one of the leading roles of the sitcom Charles in Charge. A big-enough hit that it would last for five seasons, <a href=#>Nicole Eggert</a> was a major part of the series from the second one on as it went through a major cast reshuffling at that point. Going on to find further success on television, she would land a gig on a seminal show of the nineties, Baywatch, which required her to spend much of her time wearing a bathing suit in front of cameras. Extremely fit at that time, once people stopped paying attention to her, she packed on so much weight that the next time she was regularly on television, it was part of a weight loss series. Appearing in a season of the show Celebrity Fit Club, it put her efforts to lose weight front and center.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=edward-furlong><strong>Edward Furlong</strong></h2><p>When putting together the highly-anticipated movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was necessary to find someone to play John Connor as a youngster, and <a href=#>Edward Furlong</a> was tapped. Thrust into international stardom as a result of being an integral part of one of the biggest movies ever, he had a lot to live up to and for a time was living up to that demand. Also a part of well-received movies like Brainscan, Pecker, American History X, and Detroit Rock City among others, he was on his way to putting together a great career. Then he would begin to struggle with substance abuse which hurt his career prospects enough that within a few years, he was all but forgotten by many. Going on to gain a great deal of weight once he seemed to kick many of his worst habits, it was a big change for his image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meg-ryan><strong>Meg Ryan</strong></h2><p>Someone that absolutely had a strong argument for being labeled America’s sweetheart for much of her career, <a href=#>Meg Ryan</a> was a big part of a series of films that were beloved by the masses. Best known for her contributions to movies like When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, Courage Under Fire, City of Angels, and You've Got Mail, she proved herself to be a marvelous actor and film star. Then, her career hit the skids and she stepped away from the spotlight after appearing in some movies that were poorly received and being a part of a few controversies. Deciding to undergo procedures that forever changed her look during a several-year period in which she didn’t appear in a single film, her face went through a drastic change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angus-t-jones><strong>Angus T. Jones</strong></h2><p>A former child star that was able to become a big deal because of how cute he was while he was growing up, <a href=#>Angus T. Jones</a> got his first starring role in the movie See Spot Run. Not exactly a huge hit, it didn’t stop him from being cast in a sitcom that, at one time, was one of the biggest hits on all of television, Two and a Half Men. Growing up in front of the world, as a result, fans would watch as he lost weight and grew into his looks over the years. Then, he went through a change of perspective on religion and saw the series he was a part of in a new way that saw him decrying its content and leaving it aside from a few cameo appearances. Also opting to change his look once he was no longer a series star, he grew a beard that looked pretty awful on him.</p><h2 id=nikki-cox><strong>Nikki Cox</strong></h2><p>Some people may not remember it now, but the show Married with Children was a gigantic TV hit at one time. As a result, when one of its co-creators departed for greener pastures, he would go on to create another show that clearly was based on its success, Unhappily Ever After. Cast in a very similar fashion, this new show included <a href=#>Nikki Cox</a> in the same style role that <a href=#>Christina Applegate</a> played in Married with Children, a beautiful, ditzy, sarcastic, and resourceful young woman. A gorgeous redhead at the time, she would go on to other shows like Las Vegas and Nikki but she is no longer a star today in large part because she looks very little like she once did. Someone who clearly went under the knife, her face was heavily modified as was her chest, and none of it was in a good way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-nolte><strong>Nick Nolte</strong></h2><p>An actor that was the picture of masculinity, <a href=#>Nick Nolte</a> was the celebrity that People Magazine chose to be the focus of an annual issue where they choose the most attractive man alive in the year 1992. A major movie star at the time, he is best known for films like 48 Hrs., The Prince of Tides, Lorenzo's Oil, Hulk, Hotel Rwanda, and Warrior. Also an acclaimed actor who took home a Golden Globe and has been nominated for three Academy Awards over his career, those are only a sampling of the accolades that have been sent his way. Once considered quite the beefcake, he is getting older and has been pictured by paparazzi looking like he has been living without a home in recent obscurity-filled years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melanie-griffith><strong>Melanie Griffith</strong></h2><p>The daughter of Hollywood legend Tippi Hedren and advertising executive Peter Griffith, from an early age, it seemed like <a href=#>Melanie Griffith</a> was destined for major success. Opting to follow in her mother’s footsteps, she would become a famous actor in her own right after her work in <a href=#>Brian De Palma</a>'s Body Double turned a lot of heads. Going on to land a long list of coveted parts, she is best known for her work in movies like Working Girl, The Bonfire of the Vanities, Pacific Heights, and Mulholland Falls among many others. Still popping up in things from time to time in recent years, her career has not come to an end but she hasn’t played a major part in a hit for many years, so she isn’t brought up a lot anymore. Perhaps that is also due to the fact that when she does work, few recognize her after the many procedures she has undergone have almost entirely changed her face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-tyson><strong>Mike Tyson</strong></h2><p>Considered one of the best boxers of all time by practically everyone, when <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a> was in his prime, he seemed pretty close to unstoppable. Extremely powerful and shockingly fast in the ring, he also had wonderful tactical ability when it came to dismantling his opponent mentally prior to the start of his bouts. As a result of all of that, his early fights would often end seemingly out of nowhere with a flurry of punches few could hope to withstand. Then, he was sent to prison for a horrible crime, and his athletic career was never what it once previously was. Eventually gone from the sport that made him a star, in the years of relative obscurity that followed, he got a face tattoo and put on enough weight to shock anyone that followed his career.</p><h2 id=priscilla-presley><strong>Priscilla Presley</strong></h2><p>Someone who rose to prominence when she,&nbsp;<a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a>, married legendary singer <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>, at one time, that made her the envy of his millions of fans. Turned into a figure of great intrigue based on that relationship, people were astonished that she caught the eye of one of the biggest celebrities in the world when she was only fourteen years old. Also an actress in her own right, she was able to make an impact on the world as one of the stars of the Naked Gun series of movies that, to this day, are considered some of the best spoofs ever. Last seen acting on film all the way back in 1999, at this point, she made the choice to go under the knife during this period of relative obscurity, and the results speak for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lex-luger><strong>Lex Luger</strong></h2><p>A professional wrestler who was near the top of the business several times over his career, <a href=#>Lex Luger</a> was even able to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two times. Sent to tour America on a bus by the WWE, during that time, he wore red, white, and blue in an effort to make him a patriotic hero. However, his popularity fell short of expectations and he never was their biggest star. Standing out from his peers for one big reason, he was not known for his sterling in-ring skills as he wasn’t a part of many awesome matches but he was in great shape. A massively muscled man throughout his famous years, after retirement, he suffered a nerve impingement in his neck which caused temporary paralysis. No longer able to work out like he once did, he has also been open about getting off of steroids, and both of those things have caused his body to shrink to a remarkable degree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lil-kim><strong>Lil’ Kim</strong></h2><p>One of the only women in history to make it in the rap game at a major level, <a href=#>Lil’ Kim</a> changed the way that many fans looked at this popular genre of music. Best known for songs like “Crush on You,” “No Time,” “Magic Stick,” “The Jump Off,” and “Big Momma Thang,” when she was at the height of her skills, there were few people that were more talked about. Also very memorable for part of the song “Lady Marmalade,” in its video, she wore very little which is something she did for most of her public appearances, and she looked pretty incredible. No longer someone who is paid attention to very much these days, that may in part be due to the fact that she looks very little like she once did because of far too much plastic surgery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brendan-fraser><strong>Brendan Fraser</strong></h2><p>An actor we have to say that we really miss being part of the movie scene, for a period of time,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brendan Fraser</a> was an actor that was very much in demand. Talented at what he did, he gave fantastic performances in films like School Ties, With Honors, as well as Gods and Monsters, the last of which saw him receiving especially glowing reviews. Also someone with a lovable presence, his greatest claims to fame came as a beloved figure in movies like Encino Man, Airheads, Bedazzled, and most of all The Mummy and its first sequel. Opting to appear in several panned films during years where he needed to cement his movie star status, that fact caused Hollywood to lose faith in him. Since then barely spoken of in any major way, he continues to quietly get work but it is the way he has transitioned into looking like a schlub that many have taken note of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lara-flynn-boyle><strong>Lara Flynn Boyle</strong></h2><p>Someone&nbsp;who seemed to have all the potential to be a massive deal in the world, we think that <a href=#>Lara Flynn Boyle</a> should still be going today, especially in light of the way she first rose to fame. One of the stars of the show Twin Peaks, in the years since that series’ first run, it has remained such a cultural touchstone that it was revived on Netflix early this year. However, she was nowhere to be seen. Also well-remembered for another show she starred in called The Practice, the film world came calling too which is why she was a big part of The Temp and Men in Black II, to name only a sampling. No longer working as an actor today, we think that is due to the bad plastic surgery she received which also made her acting skills much less persuasive.</p><h2 id=kenny-rogers><strong>Kenny Rogers</strong></h2><p>An absolute legend when it comes to country music, <a href=#>Kenny Rogers</a>’&nbsp;musical contributions led to his voice being part of the soundtrack to many people’s lives. Somebody who released a stunning thirty-nine studio albums and eighty singles over his lengthy career, the man has been a part of so many songs that it is difficult to overstate his musical legacy. Best known for songs like “The Gambler,” “Kenny,” “Lady,” “Islands in the Stream,” and far too many more to list here, it is safe to say that he was fantastic at what he does. No longer releasing hit songs for a number of years now, he still toured up until recently but the main thing that he has done that garnered attention is get enough plastic surgery to look very unnatural.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yasmine-bleeth><strong>Yasmine Bleeth</strong></h2><p>The second former Baywatch star to make it to this list, <a href=#>Yasmine Bleeth</a> was a major part of the series during the height of its glory years. While the series was better known for the contributions of its stars,&nbsp;<a href=#>David Hasselhoff</a> and <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a>, the effect this actor had on its popularity is hard to overstate. In fact, when one of the biggest TV shows off all time, Friends, featured her series as a part of a major storyline, it was a scene of her running in slow motion that it focused on. Otherwise best known for appearing in the soap opera One Life to Live, her last credited film or television role was as part of things released in the year 2003. Mostly forgotten by the world due to that fact, it was a big surprise to many when her image was taken by a paparazzi, and she was much larger than she was during her famous years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-seagal><strong>Steven Seagal</strong></h2><p>One of a group of men that were seen as the biggest action stars of the late eighties and early nineties, <a href=#>Steven Seagal</a> was such a big deal due to his martial arts skills. Best known for movies like Above the Law, Hard to Kill, Under Siege, and Exit Wounds, his career had two periods of relevance which saw the masses looking forward to his films. That has not been the case for several years, however, but he did receive some attention when he starred in a “reality” show called Steven Seagal: Lawman. Now an outspoken defender of a man that is believed to be a ruthless killer by many, <a href=#>Vladimir Putin</a>, that fact may make his change in look a little bit easier to understand. Gaining a lot of weight over the years, as of late, he has also had dramatically-dyed hair plugs put in and taken to wearing clothes which all serve to make him look like a Bond villain of some kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daryl-hannah><strong>Daryl Hannah</strong></h2><p>Someone who rose to fame after appearing in the movie Blade Runner, that movie changed&nbsp;<a href=#>Daryl Hannah</a>'s look to a large degree but showed off her impressive figure.
