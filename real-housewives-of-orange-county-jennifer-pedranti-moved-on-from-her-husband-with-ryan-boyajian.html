Jennifer and William were together for a little over 18 years before separating in January 2021.</p><p>According to Radar, William filed for divorce from his wife Jennifer in March 2022. The court document revealed the marriage date and the date of separation of the couple, but it did not include the dating period before the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>William requested joint physical and legal custody of the children and agreed to pay spousal support to his wife on the divorce filing. According to Radar, William did not hire any lawyers and filed the form himself, his educational background in law might have been sufficient to file for the divorce on his own.&nbsp;</p><p>He cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the separation. Jennifer filed the response three months later on June 7. The two appeared to be on the same page as she did not dispute on any claims made by her estranged beau.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Jennifer did note that the communal property was not confirmed at the moment and was still awaiting verification. Radar reports the couple owns a 5-bedroom home worth $2.4 million together which they still share.</p><h2 id=jennifer-has-five-children><span class=ez-toc-section id=jennifer-has-five-children></span> Jennifer Has Five Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Pedranti children are five in number. Jennifer recently adopted her son Dominic who is 8 years old.</p><p>The names of her little ones are Dawson, Greyson, Everleigh, Dominic and an unnamed eldest child.</p><p>According to Radar, the court filing made by William revealed the names and ages of their children as Dominic who was 8 years old at the time was the youngest of the brood.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, her son Dawson was 15 years old at the time, their other child Greyson was 13, and Everleigh was 11 years old at the time of the filing. The court documents do not include anything about the reportedly 18-year-old eldest child in the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Jennifer’s Instagram account reads she is a mother to five adorable children, William’s court filing only listed four minor children produced from the marriage. It is unclear if she has a child from another relationship or if one of the pair’s children is already an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Jennifer’s RHOC bio revealed she is a mother to five kids ranging in age from 5 to 18 years old. She has never clarified about her kids but has sometimes shared pictures with them on her social media account.</p><p>Dawson is found on Instagram with his username @dawson_pedranti where he has a little over 200 followers. Dawson is in a relationship with Hannah according to his Instagram profile, but they have not shared any images together on the social media platform.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqVlrlutM6uqp6vmauytHnOn2SoqpGjtKZ5wqisp6ypYremus2inZ6qXaWypb7Ap6uiZZ2kw6awjKilZp6ipLputMSrZKGto5eur7CMsKCtoF2nxqK6jJumspmanq6vew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-of-orange-county-jennifer-pedranti-moved-on-from-her-husband-with-ryan-boyajian.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-10-most-expensive-superyachts-in-the-world-as-of-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-10-most-expensive-superyachts-in-the-world-as-of-2022.html>The 10 Most Expensive Superyachts In The World, As Of 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mary-ruth-joyner-net-worth-flo-jo-daughter-age-wikipedia-and-husband.html>Mary Ruth Joyner Net Worth Flo Jo Daughter Age, Wikipedia And Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mary-ruth-joyner-net-worth-flo-jo-daughter-age-wikipedia-and-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
