"I was drunk. I was not tipsy, I was drunk. But I was not beyond the point of recollection. I know where I was. But, on the way out [of Tristan's house] he did kiss me. No passion, no nothing. On the way out he just kissed me. It was a kiss on the lips. No tongue kiss, no making out. Nothing. I don't think he's wrong either, because I allowed myself to be in this position," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woods revealed</a>. "I didn't know how to feel. I was like, 'That didn't just happen,' because I was leaving already so I walked out immediately after. And I got in the car and was like, 'No, that didn't happen,' I [told him] I need to go. I was in shock."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-talked-about-jordyn-in-the-39-kuwtk-39-finale-in-2021><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kylie Jenner Talked About Jordyn In The 'KUWTK' Finale In 2021</span></h2><p>During the Keeping Up With Kardashians reunion which aired in June 2021, Kylie Jenner talked about her feelings toward Jordyn Woods. "Jordyn and I did have a talk after that," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reality television star admitted</a>. "When we were friends, we never thought that we wouldn't be friends. It was kind of an overnight thing, and, you know, when she did something to my family, it felt like she did something to me." Considering that this was over two years after the incident, it's safe to say that the two have not given their friendship another chance. After the reunion aired, fans were not happy with the fact that <a href=#>Kylie is still blaming Jordyn, but not Tristan</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-khloe-kardashian-stand-in-the-way-of-kylie-and-jordyn-39-s-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Does Khloe Kardashian Stand In The Way Of Kylie And Jordyn's Friendship?</span></h2><p>In the same reunion of Keeping Up With Kardashians, Khloe Kardashian clarified that she wouldn't mind if her sister Kylie Jenner rekindled her friendship with Jordyn Woods. "I have told Kylie intimately that I would genuinely not care whatsoever if Kylie wants to be her friend again," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe said</a>. "My sisters matter way more to me than any grudge or issue that I would have with another individual. And if I can allow Tristan back into my life, I need to allow the same forgiveness and acceptance of other people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-kris-jenner-want-kylie-and-jordyn-to-be-friends-again><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Does Kris Jenner Want Kylie And Jordyn To Be Friends Again?</span></h2><p>Two years after the cheating scandal, Kris Jenner sent Jordyn Woods a PR package from Safely — her line of eco-friendly cleaning products with Chrissy Teigen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Muddy Truth About Kylie Jenner's Billionaire Status In 2022">The Muddy Truth About Kylie Jenner's Billionaire Status In 2022</a></span></p><p>In April 2021, Jordyn Woods <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared photos of the PR package on her Instagram</a>, and apart from the products she also received a handwritten note and a bouquet of fresh flowers.</p><h2 id=jordyn-woods-hopes-her-and-kylie-jenner-find-their-way-back-to-each-other><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jordyn Woods Hopes Her And Kylie Jenner Find Their Way Back To Each Other</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the summer of 2019, Jordyn Woods revealed that she wants nothing but the best for her former best friend.

In fact, according to the outlet, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordyn Woods might have been present when Kylie Jenner hung out with Megan Thee Stallio</a>n in July 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-and-jordyn-still-have-photos-together-on-instagram><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kylie And Jordyn Still Have Photos Together On Instagram</span></h2><p>While many may have expected that the two former besties would delete the photos in which they are together, it seems as if both of them kept the pics on their feed. It is impossible to tell if there is a reason for this, but many fans believe that they kept the photos because <a href=#>they miss each other</a>, and they believe that one day they will manage to be close again.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Jordyn Woods Throws Shade At Khloé Kardashian For Trying To 'Cancel Her'">Jordyn Woods Throws Shade At Khloé Kardashian For Trying To 'Cancel Her'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiisqSZmnqrsc2nnKtlmqS%2FpcXNZq6op5SoerTAyKWjZp6inrKvsNJmq6icka56tb7IrKuapl2ptbC5z6ymp2WTnbKiwMinnmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-s-going-on-with-their-friendship-these-days.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yes-way-rose-co-founders-on-valentine-s-day-must-haves.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yes-way-rose-co-founders-on-valentine-s-day-must-haves.html>Yes Way Rose Co-Founders on Valentines Day Must-Haves</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-between-freddie-highmore-and-ex-girlfriend-abigail-breslin.html>What Happened Between Freddie Highmore And Ex-Girlfriend Abigail Breslin?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-between-freddie-highmore-and-ex-girlfriend-abigail-breslin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
