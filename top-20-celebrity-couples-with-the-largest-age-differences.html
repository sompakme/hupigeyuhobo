Think about it: where fame and money collide, it can be difficult to find true love. So when we see a lovey-dovey duo on the red carpet, we can’t help but be a bit weary. Some of these relationships and marriages play out and become totally awesome, while others fall by the wayside. Here is our list of the 20 Celebrity Couples with the Largest Age Differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you will see, some of these partnerships are still going strong, and the couples look great and very happy together. We imagine that it must be nearly impossible to have an easy-breezy relationship in Tinseltown, but these celebs make it look like a piece of cake!</p><p>That isn’t to say that some of these pairings are just downright creepy. Age differences maxing out past the two-decade time span make us a bit squeamish. Even so, these celebrities seem to be enjoying the moment, and perhaps they really are just madly in love! Have fun looking through these somewhat odd pairings and keep in mind that all is fair in love and war. Or so they say!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-adam-levine-amp-behati-prinsloo---10-years><strong>20. Adam Levine & Behati Prinsloo - 10 years</strong></h2><p>Oh, <a href=#>Adam Levine</a>. He is one of the Sexiest Men Alive (just ask People Magazine, or any female on earth.) The Maroon 5 singer and frontman can have pretty much any chick he wants. So it really is no surprise that he is now in a romantic relationship with Behati Prinsloo, gorgeous model 10 years his junior. What a lucky girl! Just in her mid-twenties, she is some great arm candy for Adam’s muscular, tattooed arms. That isn’t to say that Behati is not awesome in her own right; she is, in fact, a very accomplished model. What a beautiful pairing.</p><h2 id=19-zac-efron-amp-michelle-rodriguez---10-years><strong>19. Zac Efron & Michelle Rodriguez - 10 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Zac Efron</a> has certainly surpassed his persona as a high-school basketball player (as he appeared on the Disney movie, High School Musical.) He has been branching out and showing off his more sophisticated acting chops and his more chiseled body. Looks like <a href=#>Michelle Rodriguez</a> wanted some of that! Despite the 10-year age gap, Zac and Michelle spent some time together in a romantic relationship, but they eventually called it quits. Could have been that Michelle was a bit too “mature” for the twenty-something actor, but we hope they both Zac and Michelle can find love elsewhere. Keep searching, you two!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=18-brad-pitt-amp-angelina-jolie---11-years><strong>18. Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie - 11 years</strong></h2><p>They are the ultimate power couple who may very well one day take over the world. Okay, so maybe not, but <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> definitely have it going on. We must say, Brad is a much better choice for Angelina than <a href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> (no offense, Billy!) Even though there are 11 years between Brad and Angelina, “Brangelina” continues to capture our hearts. They have adopted, had their own kids, and finally tied the knot to make it official! On top of their stellar acting skills, they are great humanitarians as well. This is a thumbs-up relationship all around!</p><p></p><h2 id=17-ryan-reynolds-amp-blake-lively---11-years><strong>17. Ryan Reynolds & Blake Lively - 11 years</strong></h2><p>Here is some gossip for you: <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> and her husband <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> have an 11-year age gap between them. Yet they have a great marriage, or so it looks! They recently welcomed a baby boy together, who is less than one year old. Cute! The actors are so proud of their family together and they seem to be showing us all that you can indeed have a successful and happy marriage, even under those bright Hollywood lights. We are so thrilled to see the Gossip Girl star finally settle down and become a mama. We hope more kids are in her future!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=16-nick-cannon-amp-mariah-carey---11-years><strong>16. Nick Cannon & Mariah Carey - 11 years</strong></h2><p>Okay, so an 11-year age gap is a bit much, but not as large as some of the other couples on our list. Still, <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> and <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> ended up calling it quits after a few years of a seemingly happy marriage. Hm, could it have been that they both had large egos and there was a bit of competition? Or could it be the 11-year age gap? Maybe something else, but all we know is that it can be a bit awkward when the wife ages and the younger husband is still in the prime of his life.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-jay-z-amp-beyonce---12-years><strong>15. Jay-Z & Beyonce - 12 years</strong></h2><p>Talk about a power couple! There may be a 12-year gap between them, but <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and <a href=#>Beyonce</a> are owning it! They even have a beautiful young daughter, Blu Ivy, who is the epitome of both Jay-Z and Beyonce’s allure. The music moguls never stop, and while they are busy practically ruling the world, they seem to still find time to keep the romance alive. Now rumors are spreading that Bey and Jay-Z are expecting another baby, and hey, we are all for it. Gotta spread the love and those awesome genes! This is one celeb pairing that we hope to see continue well into the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-stephen-moyer-amp-anna-paquin---12-years><strong>14. Stephen Moyer & Anna Paquin - 12 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stephen Moyer</a> is 44 years old and <a href=#>Anna Paquin</a> is 32 years old. A 12-year age gap has not stopped this celeb couple from tying the knot and starting a family together. Another interesting tidbit is that Paquin came out in 2010 as a bisexual, and this was just a few months prior to her marriage to Moyer. No biggie! The True Blood star is still happily married and she is a proud mamma as well. Moyer seems content with his new family, and the couple looks great despite being separate in age by over a decade. Could it be true love?</p><p></p><h2 id=13-megan-fox-amp-brian-austin-green---13-years><strong>13. Megan Fox & Brian Austin Green - 13 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Megan Fox</a> is a hot young thing, so what is she doing going around with a guy who is 13 years her senior? Well, Megan can have whoever she wants, and it looks like that person is <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>! The couple do look cute together, and even had their relationship tested in a very scary way when they were hit by a drunk driver! The two celebs are doing okay, and things must be going strong because the couple have married and had two kids together. They are the proud parents of son Bodhi, who is just 9 months old, and Noah, aged 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-hugh-jackman-amp-deborra-lee-furness---13-years><strong>12. Hugh Jackman & Deborra-Lee Furness - 13 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> and Deborra-Lee Furness seem to have a fun and loving marriage, even though there are 13 long years between them. Even so, the couple was recently spotted hitting the beach for a summer vacay together, and they looked absolutely in love with each other. How great! The couple is also doing great things together, such as working on Deborra-Lee’s charity, Adopt Change. A 13-year age difference appears to be nothing – these two look gorgeous together and we wish them many more happy years of marriage! Here is living proof that age is just a number and true love can conquer anything!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-sean-penn-amp-charlize-theron---15-years><strong>11. Sean Penn & Charlize Theron - 15 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sean Penn</a> and <a href=#>Charlize Theron</a> had a whopping 15 years between them (Charlize is the younger one, of course!) With such a large age difference, it is no surprise that the Hollywood couple called it quits recently. Now Sean has been seen going around with another hot younger lady: Emmanuelle Vaugier, who is famous for her role on the CSI television series. No worries, though. With those stunning good looks and acting chops, Charlize is pretty much guaranteed to find another sweetie, maybe even another sugar daddy! Although she might want to keep the age difference to something under a decade…</p><p></p><h2 id=10-dominic-purcell-amp-annalynne-mccord---17-years><strong>10. Dominic Purcell & AnnaLynne Mccord - 17 years</strong></h2><p>These two had an age difference that spanned 17 years. Perhaps that was just a bit too much time, and could explain why they decided to end their relationship back in December of 2014. Yet they did have 3 years together as a couple, so things must have been somewhat enjoyable, at least for a little bit. Anyway, one of them seems to be rebounding just fine: Dominic was seen with another lady shortly after his breakup from AnnaLynne. Ouch! Well, since AnnaLynne is stunning and talented (she’s also a great model!), we are sure that she will find someone new as well very soon.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-olivier-sarkozy-amp-mary-kate-olsen---17-years><strong>9. Olivier Sarkozy & Mary-Kate Olsen - 17 years</strong></h2><p>Dating older men must run in the Olsen family, because Ashley’s twin sister, <a href=#>Mary-Kate</a> has also been in a relationship with an older man! With a 17-year gap between Mary-Kate and Olivier Sarkozy, apparently there has been some romance brewing between them. Perhaps they have both found a way to bond by being somewhat “has-beens” in the public sphere: Mary-Kate no longer acts and Olivier is an ageing finance expert. He is also the half-bro of former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Connection! After 3 years of dating, the couple actually decided to tie the knot in an under-the-radar wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-bradley-cooper-amp-suki-waterhouse---17-years><strong>8. Bradley Cooper & Suki Waterhouse - 17 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> may have an affinity for appearing in films with <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> (and the two do have awesome chemistry together, if we do say so ourselves.) Yet, the actor was in a relationship with Suki Waterhouse, who is 17 years younger than him. Sadly, the romantic relationship ended in a breakup, but it seems that Bradley and his ex Suki are on amicable terms. The two were spotted hanging out together and grabbing a bite to eat after the announcement of their split broke out into the news. Maybe Bradley is having second thoughts about leaving the beautiful British model!</p><p></p><h2 id=7-bennett-miller-amp-ashley-olsen---19-years><strong>7. Bennett Miller & Ashley Olsen - 19 years</strong></h2><p>The Olsen twins never cease to amaze us, although as they get older, it seems to be in a more mind-boggling way. Case in point: <a href=#>Ashley Olsen</a> has been involved with a man 19 years her senior: Bennett Miller. The two have been spotted gallivanting around New York City and elsewhere. In a relationship that began on the down-low, Ashely and Bennett became more prevalent in the public eye, and it is a strange pairing indeed. But who are we to judge? Anyway, Ashley is still honing her businesswoman chops while Bennett is working as a director. Lights, camera, action!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-jason-statham-amp-rosie-huntington-whiteley---20-years><strong>6. Jason Statham & Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - 20 years</strong></h2><p>There is a 20-year age gap between <a href=#>Jason Statham</a> and <a href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a>, but they seem to enjoy each other’s company. They are the epitome of that long sought-after couple: he is muscular and manly and she is petite and pretty. Well, they certainly have that going for them! As Jason continues acting and Rosie does her modeling gigs, they must also be doing something to keep their relationship going strong. Perhaps there will be a long-term marriage that comes out of all this? We will keep our fingers crossed! In the meantime, we will keep watching them hang out together and look absolutely adorable.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-harrison-ford-amp-calista-flockhart---23-years><strong>5. Harrison Ford & Calista Flockhart - 23 years</strong></h2><p>Perhaps <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a> has channeled his inner Indiana Jones and that is what is helping him keep his marriage to <a href=#>Calista Flockhart</a> alive and well. There is 23-year age gap between the couple, yet they seem to be doing quite well. Although Harrison was caught in a plane crash and suffered injury, his wife was there by his side and went to visit her ailing hubby. Aw! As the two actors continue to get older, we sincerely hope that they can stick together. After all, they do make a nice pairing. Their careers don’t seem to be doing too bad, either!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-aaron-taylor-johnson-amp-sam-taylor-wood---23-years><strong>4. Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Sam Taylor-Wood - 23 years</strong></h2><p>It looks as though this couple is doing quite well also. Even though there are a whopping 23 years between them, Aaron and Sam seem to still be lovey dovey with each other. The couple is often seen going on dates and other outings together, which a cute sight to see. We hope their marriage will last, and it is a great testament that with dedication and true love, even a large age difference does not have to bring a couple apart. Aaron is a great gentleman to Sam, and it is a refreshing sight when all we seem to see in the media now is unhappiness in love.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-johnny-depp-amp-amber-heard---23-years><strong>3. Johnny Depp & Amber Heard - 23 years</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> is the pure definition of weird and intriguing, so it really does not surprise us that he was in a relationship with a woman who was 23 years younger than him! Johnny and Amber Heard are going through married life together for a bit, and Amber admits that yes, Johnny Depp is a weirdo! It may very well be the large age difference, or just Johnny Depp being, well, Johnny Depp. Amber also came out as being bisexual, making her an awesome role model for others out there. She is going to hit age 30 soon, so she has loads of life ahead of her, and we hope that her free spirit relationship with Depp continues to flourish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-humphrey-bogart-amp-lauren-bacall---25-years><strong>2. Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall - 25 years</strong></h2><p>Here is a historical celeb pairing. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were an iconic Hollywood couple. With 25 years between them, they are definitely a couple for the record books. Perhaps they were just lucky in love, or they had some special innate bond between them. Whatever the case, people are still talking about Bogart and Bacall. They shared screen time and a family together. They also had plenty of ups and downs. There were tons of instances when it seemed that their romantic relationship was fraying at the edges. Still, this is a romance that we just can never forget.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-michael-douglas-amp-catherine-zeta-jones---25-years><strong>1. Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones - 25 years</strong></h2><p>As they were married for an impressive 13 years, we thought that <a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> and <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> somehow had managed to put their 25-year age gap behind them. Yet as it turns out, it may have been a deciding factor in their split. Hey, we can’t blame them, they’ve got a quarter of a century between them! As they mature and get older, there is no doubt that things would begin to get a bit weird! The Hollywood couple has had breaks in their relationship and perhaps they just needed some time to take a breather and act their respective ages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>celebuzz.com</a>, <a href=#>people.com</a>, <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>mirror.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2noGJ%2FcXnCnqOemqKewbp5wqisqaSVqHq4tdOhZK2glWK5or7GnqqtZZGcsm6wyJ%2BdnqqVo7Cmv44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-20-celebrity-couples-with-the-largest-age-differences.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-between-tim-pool-and-adam-crigler-on-timcastirl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-between-tim-pool-and-adam-crigler-on-timcastirl.html>What Happened Between Tim Pool And Adam Crigler On TimcastIRL?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-10-richest-universities-in-america-and-how-much-they-re-worth.html>The 10 Richest Universities in America (And How Much They're Worth)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-10-richest-universities-in-america-and-how-much-they-re-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
