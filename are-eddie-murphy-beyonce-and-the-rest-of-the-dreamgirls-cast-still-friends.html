The powerhouse icon is played phenomenally by <strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong>, who became famous after competing on Season 3 of American Idol but got mega famous after starring in the 2006 film <strong>Dreamgirls</strong> alongside <strong>Beyonce</strong>, <strong>Jamie Foxx</strong>, and <strong>Eddie Murphy</strong>. With all the buzz about Respect, many are looking back at Jennifer Hudson's first hit movie and as such, Dreamgirls is experiencing a bit of a nostalgic moment in the news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to believe, but it was released 15 years ago, and cast members have all moved on, with many experiencing even bigger success than the film (we're looking at you, Beyonce!). We wanted to see how much things have changed between the stars of this hit movie in the last 15 years. Here's what we know about the friendships of Eddie Murphy, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, and the rest of the Dreamgirls cast.</p><h2 id=jennifer-hudson-and-beyonce><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jennifer Hudson And Beyonce</span></h2><p>As recently as 2016, <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a> has confirmed that she is still <a href=#>great friends</a> with Queen Bey herself. At that time, she told E!, "I just went to see Beyoncé in concert twice. She knows when I'm coming every time!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that they had also recently seen each other at the CFDA Awards because Beyonce was being honored there and Jennifer Hudson performed there. They had texted beforehand to make plans to meet up. Imagine having Beyonce's number in your phone!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Just Some Amazing Things Beyoncé Has Done For The World</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce-and-jamie-foxx><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Beyonce And Jamie Foxx</span></h2><p>Jamie Foxx was friends with Beyonce and <a href=#>her husband</a> Jay-Z prior to filming Dreamgirls, so it's no surprise they've remained close long after the fact. You might think being friends already would have made him more comfortable in the scenes where his and Beyonce's characters kissed, but apparently that wasn't the case. Jamie Foxx reports being extremely nervous to film the scene and later even said he hated doing it because he was so nervous! He even jokingly apologized to Jay-Z for "staring a little too long" at his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Beyoncé’s Dad Claims That Destiny’s Child Isn’t Planning A Comeback But Fans Don’t Buy It</a></span></p><h2 id=jamie-foxx-and-eddie-murphy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jamie Foxx And Eddie Murphy</span></h2><p>Fans were delighted when Eddie Murphy made his <a href=#>return to standup</a> last year. His pal Jamie Foxx had some wise, if a little unorthodox, advice. He reportedly told Eddie that he needed to fix his house. "'Your house is too perfect. You’ve got the candles scented and all that.' I said, ‘Eddie, I have s*** at my house that doesn’t work on purpose so I stay funny.’ I got this little carpet that’s in the kitchen that’s sort of ruffled up. And I got a bathroom where you turn on the faucet and it sprays out. My daughter’s like, ‘Why don’t you fix that?’ I said, ‘I feel like if I fix all this shit I won’t be funny.’" There you have it, folks - the key to comedy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-and-sheryl-lee-ralph><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Beyonce And Sheryl Lee Ralph</span></h2><p>Sheryl Lee Ralph wasn't in the film version, but originated Beyonce's role on Broadway. So, not quite costars - actually something more intimate! Because both actors played the same role, they share an intimate understanding of getting into the same character's head, and the two are lifelong friends after such a close experience. Beyonce reportedly told Sheryl Lee Ralph, "I just have to thank you for everything you have done for all of us girls to come behind you."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Jamie Foxx Really Changed His Name</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-foxx-and-jennifer-hudson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jamie Foxx And Jennifer Hudson</span></h2><p>Almost ten years after the making of Dreamgirls, Jamie Foxx celebrated his 48th birthday with a very special surprise. Unbeknownst to him, Jennifer Hudson was tapped to <a href=#>serenade him</a> at a surprise birthday party his friends threw for him at Le Bilboquet, a restaurant in New York City. His former costar belted out "And I Am Telling You," which attendees all agreed was the best moment of the party. They've also run into each other on WGNTV, where Jamie Foxx spoke affectionately to Jennifer and the tone made it clear that they were indeed just two old friends catching up.</p><h2><span class=item-num>2 </span><span></span></h2><h2 id=jennifer-hudson-and-eddie-murphy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Hudson And Eddie Murphy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friends may be a stretch, but we know that Jennifer Hudson definitely admires Eddie Murphy, though they may not be in touch anymore. During one of her many interviews surrounding the release of Respect, she explained she has one big career move left to make: she really wants to star in a live action Disney movie. Citing Eddie Murphy's career and that of other costars, she said, "[He's] done everything. Where's my Disney role?" She's even got the details worked out and knows what role she would want to play: Calliope in Hercules. She explained that she had played the role on a Disney cruise ship before and felt more than ready to tackle the character again onstage. Perhaps this would mean her Dreamgirls cast coming out to support her...either way, we're rooting for it to happen!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Jamie Foxx Originally Turned Down A Role In 'Dreamgirls', But Changed His Mind Thanks To This Actor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmrGltcRmpK6qoJ3Gbq7Esqanm5VisbOxwKaeoqqcqHqkrdKtZKysmaG5brLRopynnKNit6a6zaKdnqpdncKlv86nZKudo6WypMCMmqmerJiWeqe%2BwKeipaGeZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-eddie-murphy-beyonce-and-the-rest-of-the-dreamgirls-cast-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cameron-diaz-says-no-more-plastic-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cameron-diaz-says-no-more-plastic-surgery.html>Cameron Diaz Says No More Plastic Surgery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./are-dylan-o-brien-sabrina-carpenter-together-a-closer-look-into-their-relationship.html>Are Dylan O'Brien &amp;amp; Sabrina Carpenter Together?
