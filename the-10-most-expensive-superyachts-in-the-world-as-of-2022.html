It was constructed by Lürssen in 2003 and is one of the world's largest yachts. The current owner, Hong Kong real estate mogul Samuel Tak Lee, paid an undisclosed member of the UAE royal family a cool $1 billion for the boat. The 115-meter-long ship was named pelorious, from the Greek for large. Terence Disdale was responsible for the interior design, and Tim Heywood did the exterior.</p><p>Both of the boat's engines are made by Wärtsilä, and together they allow it to reach a top speed of 20 knots. Not visible from anywhere else on board is the main suite's adjoining private deck, one of the ship's most outstanding features. Pelorus has gone through many different owners over the years. Hollywood billionaire David Geffen once owned it; before that, a Saudi Arabian businessman sold it to Roman Abramovich.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=al-said-300-million>Al Said – $300 million</h2><p>The Al Said is owned by the Sultan of Oman and is the seventh longest in the world at over 159 meters, as reported by Boat International. Super Yacht Times reports that Al Said can accommodate up to 70 guests and more than 150 crew members. This is something not everyone can afford, thankfully, there are tons of <a href=#>expensive yachts that one can rent</a>. The yacht, named for the late Sultan of Oman Qaboos Bin Said Al Said, is rumored to have an unidentified member of the Omani royal family. Little information about its plush amenities is available, although its performance hall can fit a 50-piece orchestra.</p><h2 id=radiant-320-million>Radiant – $320 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lurssen launched this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end motor yacht</a> built in 2009. The boat currently belongs to Abdulla Al Futtaim, a multimillionaire in the United Arab Emirates. Two MTU, 16V 1163 TB73L engines are under the hood, each producing 8715 horsepower. The yacht's top speed is 21 knots, and it can reach that speed quickly. The 96,000-gallon fuel capacity of the Radiant is remarkable.</p><p>The Radiant is undoubtedly impressive as the 32nd largest luxury yacht in the world. It has enough room to accommodate 20 guests and 44 staff members. The Radiant has a gym, sauna, steam room, sauna, massage room, swimming platform, tender garage, movie theater, air conditioning, and jacuzzi on the deck.

Blohm + Voss of Hamburg created this extravagant yacht for Russian oligarch Andrey and his wife, Aleksandra Melnichenko, in the style of a stealthy warship or submarine.</p><p>The Motor Yacht A is, as predicted, a paragon of luxury just like <a href=#>Tiger Woods' $20 million superyacht</a>. There are six guest bedrooms, which guests can turn into four larger cabins thanks to the boat's moveable walls, and the main bedroom and disco measure 2,500 square feet.</p><h2 id=serene-330-million>Serene – $330 million</h2><p>EspenOeino, a world-renowned yacht designer, was responsible for engineering and designing the yacht's stunning appearance while they hired Reymond Langton Design to create luxurious interiors. They constructed this high-end boat in Italy in August of 2011. Yuri Shefler, a Russian vodka magnate, commissioned Fincantieri, an Italian shipyard, to build it to his specifications.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Serene is an 8321-ton ship that is 439.4 feet long, 60.844 feet wide, and has a good beam of 10 feet. It is powered by a pair of screws, a big selling point. Up to 24 passengers and 52 staff members can rest comfortably. One of the world's largest super yachts, Serene can carry up to 64 passengers.</p><h2 id=dubai-350-million>Dubai – $350 million</h2><p>Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei commissioned the Dubai from Blohm + Voss and Lürssen shipyards more than a decade before the ship's launch in 2006. Platinum Yachts bought it for His Highness Sheik Mohammed Rashid al-Maktoum, who had its lavish interior designed.</p><p>The <a href=#>boat's most&nbsp;luxurious&nbsp;features</a> are the sun decks, jacuzzis, and pool with intricate hand-tiled designs. The circular glass steps of the magnificent staircase change color with the sunlight streaming in from the upper deck. The interior is similarly adorned with handmade mosaics of intricate patterns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=motor-yacht-a-527-million-formerly-known-as-topaz>Motor Yacht A+ – $527 million (formerly known as Topaz)</h2><p>Topaz has an overall length of 147 meters, a beam of 21 meters, and a gross capacity of 11,589.

In case of emergency, a diesel generator is included.</p><h2 id=azzam-600-million>Azzam – $600 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 179-meter yacht has held the title of largest private yacht since 2013. The German shipyard Lürssen Yachts created a technologically advanced floating work of art. Azzam has a missile defense system and a bulletproof main suite. This boat is so well-balanced that even at full speed, the chandelier in the interior remains unruffled.</p><p>In addition, the total 35,048 kW output of its four engines makes it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the world's fastest yachts</a>, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 30 knots.</p><h2 id=eclipse-1-5-billion>Eclipse – $1.5 billion</h2><p>Eclipse was constructed in Hamburg by Blohm + Voss and is 536 feet long, making it the second largest ship in the world. The enormous size of the Eclipse is due to the boat's&nbsp;<a href=#>loads of luxurious amenities</a>. This includes 24 guest cabins, two swimming pools, multiple hot tubs, a disco hall, three launch boats, two helicopter pads, and a mini-submarine that can dive as deep as 50 meters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, the main bedroom and bridge of the yacht have fitted armor plates and bulletproof windows for optimal security, and the Eclipse is equipped with intruder detection systems and a missile defense system.</p><h2 id=history-supreme-4-8-billion>History Supreme – $4.8 billion</h2><p>Stuart Hughes created the superyacht History Supreme for a mysterious Malaysian billionaire whom Forbes suspects to be Robert Kuok, founder of the Shangri-La Hotel and Resorts company, with a net worth of $12 billion.

Last but not least, among the numerous lavish amenities on the History Supreme, the world's priciest yacht, is an iPhone encased in 500 cut diamonds.
