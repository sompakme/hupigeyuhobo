Despite good reviews and a loyal audience, the series was unable to last beyond its two-season run on ABC.</p><p>Fans have been genuinely curious about why the show was axed, and we have some details below that might provide some insight behind the network's decision.</p><h2 id=39-bless-this-mess-39-was-a-short-lived-show>'Bless This Mess' Was A Short-Lived Show</h2><p>2019's Bless This Mess was a single camera sitcom that debuted on ABC.</p><p>Starring Dax Shepard and Lake Bell, who also co-created the show, Bless This Mess was a series focused on a couple leaving behind their digs in New York in favor of small town Nebraska.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When discussing what went into making the show unique, Bell said, "The challenge I try to pay attention to is space and expanse. What’s unique to ‘Bless This Mess’ is we shoot ‘on location’ — we don’t have a soundstage, so everything is texturally very authentic. You can see in the episodes that there’s texture to these little bits of messiness, and I had to fight really hard for that. I think now that the tone is more established, the editors, the producers, the network, and the studio are comfortable with it.”</p><p>For two seasons, the series was able to please fans and tell an interesting story. Sadly, this was not enough to keep the good times rolling on ABC.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why ‘Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist’ Was Cancelled?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-was-canceled-after-two-seasons>It Was Canceled After Two Seasons</h2><p>In 2020, after just two seasons on the air, it was announced that Bless This Mess was being axed by its network.</p><p>"ABC is cleaning up its act, canceling Bless This Mess after two seasons, TVLine has learned. News of Bless This Miss’ cancellation comes on the heels of ABC renewing 13 series. The network also axed Emergence, Schooled and Single Parents. This season leading out of ABC’s No. 1 comedy (The Conners), Bless This Messaveraged a 0.67 demo rating and 3.6 million total viewers, right on par with its freshman run. Out of the 10 sitcoms ABC aired this TV season, it ranked No. 5 in both measures," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a> reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People were pretty surprised to see that the show was coming to an end. Not only was it maintaining decent ratings, but the show was enjoyed by both fans and critics. In fact, Bless This Mess' overall average open Rotten Tomatoes is an impressive 82.5%.</p><p>Despite this show having a lot going for it, the network still decided to pull the plug, leading many to wonder why this was the case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Fans Thought Cobra Kai Was Canceled</a></span></p><h2 id=why-it-was-canceled>Why It Was Canceled?</h2><p>So, why was the shown canceled? Unfortunately, networks tightening things up after the onset of the pandemic might have played a factor in this decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Viewership for the show actually went up during Bless This Mess' second season, where it averaged nearly four million viewers per episode. While it wasn't a ratings smash, it was a solid performer for ABC that looked like it was building an audience through word of mouth. While it was assumed Bless This Mess season 3 would happen, ABC canceled it and other shows like Single Parents in May 2020," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a> reported.</p><p>"While there has not been any official word on why Bless This Mess was canceled, the timing of its cancellation likely holds the key. May 2020 was early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of studios were working to tighten their belts. With production on hold for many projects, there were several that it was easier to just cancel, and Bless This Mess likely met its fate because of this," the site continued.</p><p>Sadly, there were many shows that fell victim to the same thing, and people who enjoyed watching bless this mess were genuinely upset that it was being booted from the net work after such a short run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hollywood Reporter did note that perhaps the network wanted to shift back to a single night of comedy programming each week, but again, nothing regarding the decision of the cancellation was made official.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's The Real Reason Why Netflix Canceled 'Jupiter's Legacy'</a></span></p><p>Bless This Mess was not able to develop into a major hit like the network wanted, but it seemed to at least be on the right track before meeting its end.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘Home & Family’ Was Canceled</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZpuasF2otaa8wKubrGWSobK0v4ytn6KrXaKytL%2BMnJinm5Whuaawjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-dax-shepard-s-bless-this-mess-got-canceled-despite-the-ratings-going-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-popular-vine-stars-where-are-they-now.html>10 Popular Vine Stars: Where Are They Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-christian-bale-doomed-the-sequel-to-terminator-salvation.html>Why Christian Bale Doomed The Sequel To Terminator: Salvation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-christian-bale-doomed-the-sequel-to-terminator-salvation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
