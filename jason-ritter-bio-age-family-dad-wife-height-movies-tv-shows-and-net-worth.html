I’m not 100 percent sure if I broke it, or what, but it definitely was broken at a certain point,” he said. “I definitely have guilty feelings and memories about it, so I think I did break it a little bit. Just the tip of the wing.”</p><p>He said he remembered staring at the award, “looking at the balls inside of the big globe and the wings and just sort of being [like], ‘What is this?’</p><p>Jason added that he can’t remember whether John got the statuette fixed.

I had never seen abuse talked about this way. I had never sat down and listened to someone tell their experience in-depth and all of the complicated emotions that went along with it, and how it can be framed for a child, and how they could carry that into adulthood.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-research-did-you-do-for-the-role></span><strong>What research did you do for the role?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>I read an incredible book called “Tiger Tiger,” which had a similar theme, but mainly I talked to Jennifer over and over about it. She is as open and honest as her script is. She was constantly willing to explore uncharted territory by telling me things that were uncomfortable, and it really helped to have that resource there. She was my anchor.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-it-hard-at-the-end-of-the-day-to-shake-this-person-off></span><strong>Was it hard at the end of the day to shake this person off?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>For the most part, we did so many things during shooting that not only helped us make it in the first place, but it helped psychologically. Any of the horrible and overt things that I say, I said them to a body double who was adult so it was easier for me to look at someone who is a peer and talk this way. I knew that there would be a certain amount of magic that would come together in the editing. There were a couple of times where I had to go home and let it all out.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-reserve-judgment-when-youre-playing-a-person-like-this></span><strong>Do you reserve judgment when you’re playing a person like this?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>That was the biggest challenge for me. I, obviously, have incredibly deep emotions about this kind of thing. It’s an immediate physical reaction; I feel rage in every fiber in my body. So, to me, I held on to the fact that I was playing a memory of this person who had spun it in a way so much that in her adult life, Jennifer was calling it a relationship. I knew it was important to not be a mustache-twirling character … because it would’ve undermined the whole point of the movie. The unsettling part is that he seemed like someone you could trust. In the community, people like him and trust him, and he was able to manipulate people.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=weve-seen-films-about-sexual-assault-before-but-the-metoo-movement-has-given-us-a-whole-new-clarity-how-do-you-think-the-film-fits-into-this-conversation></span><strong>We’ve seen films about sexual assault before, but the #MeToo movement has given us a whole new clarity. How do you think the film fits into this conversation?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>I think it continues the conversation. One of the most incredible things about #MeToo is that, due to this instinctual safety in numbers thing, #MeToo created a place where someone could say something about an experience they had and feel, “Maybe I’ll be believed” as opposed to, “What was my participation level? What did I do wrong?” I think this film continues that conversation.</p><p>One of the things that it does is that it teaches people to try and not put their own narrative on someone else’s experience, and say “You were a victim.” If you’re worried that your story may get taken from you and specifically labeled, you may never tell that story. You have to let the person come to their own understandings about it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jason-ritter-goliath></span><span>Jason Ritter Goliath</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Jason Ritter Boards David E.
